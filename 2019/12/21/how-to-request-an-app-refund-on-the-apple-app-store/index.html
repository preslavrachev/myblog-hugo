                    <p>Buying the wrong product happens all the time, and apps make no exception to that. Although it does not apply to every country, if you live within the EU, you have the right to ask for a full refund of your purchases, no strings attached. You can do that with apps you have bought from the App Store too, without having to provide an explanation. It is actually very easy, though providers try to put a few stones on the way. In the case of the App Store, I don’t think you can really do it from the app itself. You have to go to a special site instead:</p>

<p><a href="reportaproblem.apple.com">https://reportaproblem.apple.com</a></p>

<p>After signing in, you will see all the apps you have downloaded for free or purchased. Find the one you want to refund (assuming, you are within 14 days of the purchase). Click on “Report a Problem” (I know, you are actually exercising your rights, but just keep playing the game). Be careful to select the right option from the menu:</p>

    <img src="/images/2019/12/appstore1.png"
         alt="The right option is down below"/> <figcaption>
            <p>The right option is down below</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>See how far below the right option is? Anyway, once you choose it, there are no further obstructions. Just hit “Cancel Purchase” and you are good to go!</p>

                    <p>Note: What follows is my answer to question on Quora. I thought it might be worth sharing with my readers too.
This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but for whatever it is worth, I am going to let my mind speak. I would like to emphasize on the fact that I am, and will always be a Bulgarian, despite my conscious choice to live and have business somewhere else.
The reason why Bulgaria is so poor has nothing to do with its nature and geographic location.</p>

                    <p>My wife and I spent the last two days in beautiful Vienna. This trip changed quite a few of the prejudices and assumptions I had previously had about the Austrian capital.
There is no doubt that Vienna is a world city, both historically, geographically, and culturally. For years in a row, the city has been named the world’s best place to live in, and as much as Munich is trying to steal the title, it’s not come close yet.</p>
