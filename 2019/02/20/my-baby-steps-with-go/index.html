                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Last week, I made my first tentative foray into Go programming. <a href="https://www.ki-labs.com/">My company</a> uses Go in a couple of projects, but although I have heard many positive things about the language, so far I have tried to stay away from it. The mere thought that Go is a 21st Century version of C and has been explicitly designed from the start to not try to be much more than that, can make everyone coming from Kotlin and Swift pull a few hairs at first. The mere mentioning of C makes me shiver when I think about the crazy stuff I wrote in early high school  (circa. <sup>2000</sup>&frasl;<sub>02</sub>). After school, I never gave C a chance anymore, but instead, moved on to languages, which at the time made my life easier.</p>

<p>In reality, programming with Go is not as harsh as I expected. Okay, it does look a lot like C, there are no classes, and pointers are everywhere, but you quickly get used to these, when you see the full picture. Unlike C, Go has a garbage collector, which means that a whole class of problems I had with memory management will simply not be present.</p>

<p>As for OOP, objects are still there, but their construction is slightly different. Go has eradicated inheritance and fosters composition instead. Go  The lack of a <code>class</code> construct has been more than sufficiently replaced by structs and <a href="https://gobyexample.com/interfaces">interfaces</a>. If all you need is a bag of properties (also referred to as &ldquo;data class&rdquo; in other languages), a <code>struct</code> should be perfectly sufficient. If you want to add functionality to your objects, Go&rsquo;s system of <a href="https://gobyexample.com/interfaces">attachable method receivers</a> makes it fairly easy to do so. In fact, after an hour of hour of work, I got pretty confident with it.</p>

<p>Pointers are also not the pain I expected them to be. In fact, they help things more transparent and explicit. Since in Go (almost) everything is passed by value (with the exception of <code>map</code> and <code>slice</code>) pointers actually help distinguish when the function you are passing the object will potentially want to mutate it or not.</p>

<p>Where Go really shines for me at the moment is the native performance and the build process. Five years ago, I would have screamed at the mere thought of this: statically compiling a binary and directly throwing it onto a remote machine where it just &hellip; works. But it does, and compared to the complexity of modern containerized systems and dependency hell, this is just a breeze of fresh air.</p>

<p>I am leaving you with the video that made me open up my eyes for Go:</p>

                    <p>A few days ago, I was invited to give a talk at the Munich Kotlin Users Group meetup (check out my slides here) For quite some time, I have had an idea to promote Kotlin as the missing link between software engineering and Data Science. DuringKotlinConf 2018, I had the chance and the privilege to meet a couple of amazing people, whose talks only helped confirm my thoughts.

                    <p>With a few short micro-post exceptions, my blog has been relatively quiet over the past month. The reason for this is simple. I have devoted much of my writing resources of the past weeks into a new site. A wiki called DevNotes.
That is right, I have started a separate writing project, parallel to my blog. Yet, before you start thinking that this is the end of the blog, don't worry.</p>
