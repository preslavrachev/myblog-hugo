<p>After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace. In no time, I started nearing the end of the group, and one by one, the people who went ahead at the start, were now looking at my back.</p>

<p>Although, I did not beat my PR of two years ago, I managed to beat my previous time on this course by 2 mins, and with a much better physical and mental condition at the end. i can say with a certainty that this was the first HM where I was not ready to give up everything at the 18th km, but clearly knew that I would finish the race. My strategy (start slowly, pick up later) has worked!</p>

<p>I want to thank my wife, and my best friends for the support, and for running along during a part of the race. You, guys are the best!!!</p>

                <section class="post-card-excerpt">
                    <p>One of the things I often hear from other developers, along with the usual âPython is slowâ, is that âmultithreading in Python sucksâ. The sad reality is that I hear those from Python developers too. While I will pretend I have not heard the former accusation (hoping youâve already heard how well Python integrates with C), I will try to bring up some light on the latter.
When I ask the same guys about why they think that multithreading in Python sucks, some of them mention the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) as the root cause.</p>
