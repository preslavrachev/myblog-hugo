{"title":"ongoing by Tim Bray · Go Creeping In","description":"I’ve seen the inside of the Google and Amazon tech stacks. There are common threads that run through them and also, I bet, through\nmost BigTechCos.  Here and there down the stack is a lot of C++ and vestigial remnants from earlier days, Perl or PHP or whatever.\nOut in front of humans, of course, JS.

Except for, here and there, you find a small but steadily increasing proportion of Go.","thumbnail_url":"","provider_name":"","provider_url":"https://www.tbray.org","author_name":"Tim Bray"}
