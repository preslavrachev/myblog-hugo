      <description>It has been almost a decade, since I last set foot in the city center of Bulgaria‚Äôs capital, Sofia. Although I fly home regularly, Sofia‚Äôs Airport is just an intermediary stop on my ultimate route to my hometown.
This time was different. My wife and I flew for the wedding of one of our best friends, and since we had a whole day to spare, we decided to take a walk through the centre of the City of Trams.</description>
