      <description>“You can think of any web server as a function. Each time you type a URL, think of it as a function call to some remote server. That function takes your request and generates some response. A web server is a natural problem for a functional language to solve.”

      <description>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</description>

      <title>[Quote] Ten Years of Erlang</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s probably not too important, in the grand scheme of things, whether you are using a language like Erlang or not. While I do feel it&amp;rsquo;s under-used and under-rated, the biggest benefit of it is not in running a system that uses it. The biggest benefit comes from learning about the fundamentals of solid system design, and internalizing its lessons in a practical context.

      <description>I happen to know and have worked together with Dom. A really inspiring person, and one, whose opinions I often share. Particularly, this one on writing and sharing your knowdledge with the world:
 Don’t question whether something is advanced enough to share it. Don’t worry if that knowledge already exists on the internet. The only question you need to ask yourself is this:
What do I know?

      <description>via Plastic synapses offer hardware alternative to neural networks | ArsTechnica
 A synapse—the connection between two neurons—consumes at most 100 femtoJoules per event. Once you realize that the entire human body is about the equivalent of an 120W light bulb, you can see that the efficiency of the brain is just astounding. [&amp;hellip;] This result has implications. If this research does turn out to be the way forward, neural networks will not operate faster than our own brains.</description>
