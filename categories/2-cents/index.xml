            <description>This post is a sort of a time capsule. An attempt to journal my thoughts at this particular point in time. Despite the seemingly rough first part, I want it to have a hopeful message. I think that now is the time to re-align our principles, and set new trajectories.
Everywhere around the world, things are still developing faster than anyone had expected. More and more people getting infected, sick, and some, eventually dying.</description>

<p>This post is a sort of a time capsule. An attempt to journal my thoughts at this particular point in time. Despite the seemingly rough first part, I want it to have a hopeful message. I think that now is the time to re-align our principles, and set new trajectories.</p>

<p>Everywhere around the world, things are still developing faster than anyone had expected. More and more people getting infected, sick, and some, eventually dying. Many of them among the classes of society, which would normally be spared the inconvenience of feeling the pain and misery of the masses. The Coronavirus is an equaliser. It spares no age, money, nor class of society.</p>

<p>For everyone else, things are moving along, albeit slowly, and under the dark forecast of an impeding economic depression. People in my circles have been fighting to keep their jobs for the first time in more than a decade. Many of them, up until a month ago still drank the cool-aid called having an impact on the world. The sincere belief that they actually help <em>make the world a better place</em>. That everything can be solved with technology. That there&rsquo;s more capital in the world than ever before. Until, the ship started sinking.</p>

<p>What surprised me is how many businesses went belly up in just a couple of months. I perfectly understand that the rules of the game have been tweaked to favour investing and chasing growth. But honestly, two months of salaries and rent and that&rsquo;s it? It&rsquo;s called high risk - high reward, I know. Yet, it still cracks me up when I think about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-doesn-t-kill-me-makes-me-stronger">What doesn&rsquo;t kill me, makes me stronger</h2>

<p>I like to believe in that maxim. If we survive this crisis, we will be stronger than ever. Actually, for some people, this situation is the perfect opportunity to start something new, hopefully having learned some mistakes from the past.</p>

<p>I, in particular, started using some of the time to go back to my personal projects. In only a couple of weeks, I have essentially managed to re-write a substantial part of <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a>&rsquo;s original code in Elixir. On top of that, there are now many new features that make the experience complete, albeit, still quite ugly. My motivation is higher than ever, but I am trying to just make things right, without overdoing them, or focusing on the useless things, such as growth.</p>

<p>Will <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a> become the YouTube of podcasting? Probably not, and I don&rsquo;t really care. It makes me happy, it serves my needs, and if it serves those of others, even better. I&rsquo;d much rather focus on making something that a small niche of customers would use and gladly support its development.</p>

<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t, so be it. Besides the time spent working on Mixtape, (which I consider valuable learning) keeping the app alive costs me nothing. The actual infrastructure costs at the moment sum up to around $7/m. Yes, you heard it right. A podcasting search engine, serving close to 3 million podcast episodes for just $7/m. And, I am not talking about some buzz-worthy cloud crap, but a tiny old-school VM that hosts Mixtape among a couple of other experiments. You can&rsquo;t beat that! <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Enough boasting. This is not the idea of the post, but to hopefully reach out to others out there, lost in their own thoughts. Yes, it&rsquo;s a tough time, but usually being down at the bottom gives you a chance to change your life. Pick up your old ideas and dreams, and start slowly, step by step.</p>

            <description>TL;DR: This is not a drill! Despite the seemingly low moratilty rate in Germany, nearly 3000 people might die by the end of April alone. We can help keep many of them alive.
Judging by how much people in Munich seem to enjoy the sunny days of spring, I am going to conclude that either:
 they all live in complete denial of the situation they already gave up they fully trust that no matter what happens, the German healthcare system would fix them in no time.</description>

<p><strong>TL;DR: This is not a drill! Despite the seemingly low moratilty rate in Germany, nearly 3000 people might die by the end of April alone. We can help keep many of them alive.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Judging by how much people in Munich seem to enjoy the sunny days of spring, I am going to conclude that either:</p>

<ul>
<li>they all live in complete denial of the situation</li>
<li>they already gave up</li>
<li>they fully trust that no matter what happens, the German healthcare system would fix them in no time.</li>
<li>it’s sunny outside, so who cares</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve said it before, and I will say it once again. Social distancing does not mean complete isolation. I am totally for taking walks and individually doing sports. But come on, having group picnics in the middle of all this, is <em>merely irresponsible</em>.</p>

<p>What’s being widely played out in the media, is how dire the situation is in Italy. In the meantime, despite the increasingly growing worries of the Germany government, some part of the population seems to be unaffected. The popular belief is that the low death rate in Germany (0.3% as of 20.03) vs. that of Italy (8.3% as of 20.03.) is a signal that the virus is either not as deadly as previously predicted, or that Germany is well-equipped to handle it. While any of these statements may be true, sources suggest that there may be a difference in counting the casualties between countries, as well as differences in test sample interpretation, etc. Therefore, I’d still stick to the global death rate of 4.1% (as of 20.03).</p>

<p>What one is clearly underestimating, is the number of German people who will potentially get infected in the coming days.</p>

<p>One does not need a Ph.D. in Data Science or some fancy AI tool to set up a simple prediction scenario of how the infection would roll out in the coming days. I used data from <a href="https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/">Berliner Morgenpost</a> and only Google Sheets for that. As we all know, viruses spread in an exponential fashion, by one person potentially infecting several other individuals. Based on the data, I calculated and plotted the daily percentage multiplier for Germany, Italy, and Europe:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020/03/infection-acceleration.png"
         alt="Infection acceleration: Germany, Italy and Europe"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Infection acceleration: Germany, Italy and Europe</h4><p>Infection acceleration: Germany, Italy and Europe</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Germany has the highest for now (~1.35), meaning, that on a single day, the total number of infected people becomes 1.35 times larger than the day before. Of course, assuming that:</p>

<ul>
<li>everyone ultimately gets infected, develops immunity, and breaks the cycle</li>
<li>measures are being taken to slow its spread</li>
<li>Doomsday comes true and everyone dies</li>
</ul>

<p>this multiplier will go down. And, looking at the data, it really seems to go down! Hurray! Let’s go out and have a beer!</p>

<p>Well, hold on a minute. The fact that seems to be slowing down does not mean that it won’t affect thousands or millions more on its way. Let’s try to do a rough prediction.:</p>

<p>This are the numbers that every source on the planet presents us every day:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020/03/infected-people.png"
         alt="infected people: Germany, Italy and Europe"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Number of infected people: Germany, Italy and Europe</h4><p><h1 id="infected-people-germany-italy-and-europe">infected people: Germany, Italy and Europe</h1></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Germany being well below Italy, and both being well below the total for Europe. By all means, the situation in Italy seems far worse, and no one can question that. What no one can see however, is the dramatic turn of events, which may cause the situation in Italy to improve rapidly, and Germany to start nose-diving.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the spread acceleration from the first chart again. Using a simple trick known to statisticians and stock traders, known as <a href="https://www.daytrading.com/moving-linear-regression">Moving Linear Regression</a> we can plot a naive prediction model for the change of this acceleration by the end of April:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020/03/mlr-acceleration-prediction.png"
         alt="MLR acceleration prediction: Germany, Italy and Europe"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>MLR acceleration prediction: Germany, Italy and Europe</h4><p>MLR acceleration prediction: Germany, Italy and Europe</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Using my newly generated acceleration values, let me try and plot the total number of people that this model predicts would get infected by the end of April:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020/03/infection-prediction.png"
         alt="Predicted # of infectied people: Germany, Italy and Europe"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Predicted number of infectied people: Germany, Italy and Europe</h4><p>Predicted # of infectied people: Germany, Italy and Europe</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>And this is where the story turns upside down. The proactive measures taken by the Italian government seem to ultimately take an effect and flatten the curve significantly. Germany, on the other hand takes a leap into the hundreds of thousands, ultimately peaking by the end of April.</p>

<p>This is a dire scenario, and one that I am crossing fingers, my naive prediction model won’t even get close to. It assumes that no further measures are taken, and the social responsibility of the population remains at the same low level. At that level of reach, even with the lower death rate in Germany would result in thousands of deaths (950.000 * 0.003 results in 2850 people dead by the end of April alone).</p>

<p>Even if none of us or our families get affected by the Coronavirus (which I sincerely hope for), we bear a social responsibility for the people we encounter. As passive transmitters, we might be causing the death of somebody, Of many. We can prevent many of those deaths from happening by just staying home.</p>

            <title>A Step Outside the Comfort Zone</title>

            <description>Yes, the current situation sucks. Big time. It&amp;rsquo;s not good for anyone. Least of all, for the ones fighting for their lives, and those, doing their best to bring things back to normal. It needs patience and coordinated effort, but we&amp;rsquo;ll make it through, sooner or later. Patience and perseverance are hard, I know, but those are what has kept humanity moving forward. They would do so, for generations to come.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the current situation sucks. Big time. It&rsquo;s not good for anyone. Least of all, for the ones fighting for their lives, and those, doing their best to bring things back to normal. It needs patience and coordinated effort, but we&rsquo;ll make it through, sooner or later. Patience and perseverance are hard, I know, but those are what has kept humanity moving forward. They would do so, for generations to come. Also, the ability to adapt to a constantly changing environment.</p>

<p>I keep seeing people I follow, express disappointment with the current situation in social media. Not so much because of fear. More, because the measures to curb the outbreak, push people to step away from the comfort zone. As individuals, we have grown to protect what&rsquo;s perceive as ours so much, that the mere act of doing something for the common good can cause a backlash.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a secret. This isn&rsquo;t the first, and won&rsquo;t be the last time that society faces a test of this kind. In markets, such phenomena are known as &ldquo;corrections&rdquo;. A very long upward run ends up with a shard downward move, only to start going up again. So is life. It has ups and downs. The general rule for living life is this: enjoy it while you&rsquo;re up, but keep in mind that there will be a day when you&rsquo;ll be down again. Also, don&rsquo;t give up hope when you&rsquo;re down. You&rsquo;ll be up again soon enough.</p>

<p>The best we can do now (besides personal hygiene) is to swallow any pride and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">distance one another from social gatherings</a> for some time. Whoever can study or work remotely, <strong>must absolutely do so</strong>. This isn&rsquo;t a time to show heroism at school, or at work, because frankly, none of this actually matters. What matters is that the lives of others are above petty profits. Plus, social distancing is not about locking oneself down completely. Regular walking, and doing sports in the open are more than welcome. I personally keep my distance running routing. Only, not in places with lots of other people.</p>

<p>Moments like now are good for a reassessment of priorities, and for questioning the Status Quo. They confront the Old with the New, and put to the test much of what society takes for granted. As a technologist, I can&rsquo;t help but ask myself a few questions. For instance, whether information technology really stands up to the promise of making our lives better. Whether solutions &ldquo;powered by AI&rdquo; can help us solve the difficult problems in life, or just drive up product sales. Whether &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; is what they really are, or simply, an individual&rsquo;s pipe dream. Whether &ldquo;remote work&rdquo; was ever going to be the future, or just an employee perk for a privileged class of the workforce. Whether media omnipresence does us any good, or helps dig the trap deeper.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Not many have found a positive answer by now.</p>

<p>Keep being strong and healthy!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>In my little more than a year day-to-day developer experience with Go, I have so far <strong>learned three things</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can change my entire view of how programming works, even after 12+ years of doing it in one form or another.</li>
<li>People are blaming Java for all the wrong reasons</li>
<li>People are praising Go for all the wrong reasons</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me explain. This post is not about saying that “language A is better than language B”, or vice versa. It is about asking ourselves the question why things work the way they do, and whether doing them differently is a bad, or potentially, good thing.</p>

<p>Before joining the Go camp, I had worked quite a few years as a Java developer, with all the stereotypes that this role could evoke in one’s head. I co-developed data-processing systems for various industries. Yet, much of the code I wrote was just boilerplate: passing data from one format to the other, or devising complex abstractions behind what should have really just been calling a function and obtaining its result. Yes, the code was difficult to comprehend, but I was proud of it for this exact reason. The more hoops I created, the more secure I felt that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was doing what I thought was right</li>
<li>If people didn’t understand the code, they’d have to come to me for an advice, further boosting my ego.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-language-is-not-to-blame-for-this">The language is not to blame for this</h2>

<p>The fact that much of the existing Java code is full of bureaucracy has nothing to do with the language itself, or with its platform. Our developer community should bear the sole responsibility. I can assure anyone that perfectly functioning Java applications can be written without 90% of the ceremony. They will be smaller and run faster. Most probably, easier to comprehend, too. And yet, they won’t get you hired in any well-respected company. They just won’t pass the <em>developer prejudice</em> test. I know. I’ve seen many elegant solutions and rejected them for not being /idiomatic/ enough.</p>

<h2 id="go-isn-t-a-silver-bullet-either">Go isn’t a silver bullet either</h2>

<p>For much of the same reasoning, jumping ship towards Go, just because “it is not Java”, won’t bring anyone far. Even before I started writing Go, I had heard and read many stories, about how simple and fast it made everything, how little ceremony it had, compared to Java, how it would eventually kill all other languages, etc. All blah, blah. Despite all of the above being true, you have to discover the truth in each for yourselves. If you approach the language out of desperation with your current way of working, you’re going to be set for a rough path.</p>

<p>See, if you all you wanted was to get a faster running (name language of choice), you could certainly do it. Yet, holding on to the mental baggage of your previous experience will be hard and messy. My first Go project started out as a rewrite of a Spring Boot app I’d started earlier, so I thought I’d just organize it the same way. To keep the story short, let’s just say it was a spectacular disaster. Only after I started from scratch, did it really start taking off.</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-language-without-with-less-idioms">Go is a language without (with less) idioms</h2>

<p>Let’s do a naive math experiment. Imagine that you could create valid programming expressions combining any 3 keywords, from a programming language’s vocabulary. Thus, if a language only has 10 keywords, the maximum number of possible expressions is 10 * 9 * 8 = 720. In contrast, a language, with, say, 20 keywords would end up having 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840 expressions. Twice as many keywords would result in almost 10 times as many expressions!</p>

<p>Languages tend to encourage the creation and use of idioms. With that many possible expressions, it’s a normal behaviour for an individual, or a group of people to start associating and using expressions for certain things. The problems usually occur when another group comes with its own way of expressing the same thing. Both are perfectly valid, but each group would have issues understanding the other.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Go having a very strict and concise nature, is totally devoid of idioms. That would be impossible. It is in our nature to try to associate and abstract certain concepts. Yet, when a language has a deliberately smaller vocabulary, the chances for different groups accidentally finding multiple ways of doing the same thing are smaller. This helps the communication between people a great deal, but comes with a very obvious downside. Code (or any written expression, for that matter) without idioms is very, very verbose.</p>

<p>So, whoever told you that Go is not a verbose language, probably either lied to you on purpose, or had’n really seen any other programming languages up until that point. But hey, we agreed that verbosity in the name of communication and common understanding is a actually a good thing, right?s</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-test-for-senior-engineers">Go is a test for senior engineers</h2>

<p>A lot has been said about the initial concept about Go, and how the idea was to design a language for juniors fresh out of college, and with little programming experience. I think that understanding the beauty of going back to the roots of programming, can be a cathartic experience for many seasoned programmers.</p>

<p>See, junior programmers start with little baggage and preconceptions, so in their view, anything that can be done with code is fair and justified. Including, burning a CPU, or erasing a disk due to an arithmetic error.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the middle of the career path, a bunch of principles start to pile up. All of them out of the desire to step on what’s already been learned, and to make sure that things are smoothly and safely without immediate supervision. Learning and applying the principles is great, because it ensures a gradual path forward. But for many, it becomes a dogma which they blindly stick to, without asking whether a simpler alternative could be better.</p>

<p>The problem with principles is that they only work well around 80% of the time. It is the remaining 20% that can be disastrous for a project, or for one’s career. It is the understanding where to apply a principle, and where to deliberately throw it away in the name of pragmatism, which turns a software engineer into a senior software engineer.</p>

<p>To really appreciate Go, one needs to learn how to discern what makes it and its community stand out from the rest. One needs to go through a phase of utter disgust with the language, for it “lacking” certain feature. Moving on despite the urge to go back to a familiar ground, would result in one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make one realise that indeed, the Go language is not what they need or want</li>
<li>Learn to appreciate going back to the roots, as well as when to favour pragmatism over principles</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, it would be an interesting experience.</p>

            <description>Note: What follows is my answer to question on Quora. I thought it might be worth sharing with my readers too.
This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but for whatever it is worth, I am going to let my mind speak. I would like to emphasize on the fact that I am, and will always be a Bulgarian, despite my conscious choice to live and have business somewhere else.
The reason why Bulgaria is so poor has nothing to do with its nature and geographic location.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note:</strong> What follows is my answer to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Bulgaria-so-poor/answer/Preslav-Rachev">question on Quora</a>. I thought it might be worth sharing with my readers too.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but for whatever it is worth, I am going to let my mind speak. I would like to emphasize on the fact that I am, and will always be a Bulgarian, despite my conscious choice to live and have business somewhere else.</p>

<p>The reason why Bulgaria is so poor has nothing to do with its nature and geographic location. Neither, is it a lack of smart brains, creative artists, or strong athletes. It also isn’t (shocking to some) a lack of money and material possessions. Nope, it is none of those.</p>

<p>What makes Bulgaria so poor is <strong>the lack of a strong society and civic spirit</strong>. We might be smart as individuals, but as a society, we are below mediocre.</p>

<p>It is this lack of strong social norms, which has led our tiny nation from one bad choice to the next, living a sub-standard level of life for decades in a row. This lack of a strong society causes distrust and apathy. Those in turn, have managed to estrange people even further from one another, ultimately leading to the disintegration of our tiny nation. It is a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>It is easy to blame it on the politicians and the mafia, but remember, neither came to power alone. Our distrust and apathy let them be where they are today.</p>

<p>It is easy to blame it on the others, but when the time comes to pay our dues, invest in our common future, or take action to discourage grey economy, we are the first to hide back in the rat hole.</p>

<p>By not showing civic courage, the Bulgarian people (myself included) have been putting a nail after nail in the coffin holding our society, but it’s not too late to act. I see hope in many places, and this makes me look at opportunities to help.</p>

<p>So, yes, my friends, Bulgarians are poor. They can’t see how rich they could have been, had they given each other a hand, instead of sneaking behind the front door, looking through the peephole.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>P.S. I fully realize that people like me are a big part of the problem. Yet, I also believe that in order to see the problem, one needs to have gotten out, only to return with fresh solutions. Sitting in the warm broth and complaining about daily life won’t help.</p>

            <description>I have been using iOS 13 / iPadOS / watchOS 6 for a couple of weeks now. My general impression: something seems a bit off. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the new features are great. I totally love the Dark Mode support, the new Notes features, etc. I also have managed to get through the whole update phase without any major issues. No iCloud syncing problems, no significant battery drain, no frequent restarts, or any of the kind.</description>

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the new features are great. I totally love the Dark Mode support, the new Notes features, etc. I also have managed to get through the whole update phase without any major issues. No iCloud syncing problems, no significant battery drain, no frequent restarts, or any of the kind. Yet, there are many tiny things that give a feeling of something unfinished. The worst thing is, those used to work in previous OS versions, and they do now too, but only sometimes:</p>

<ul>
<li>copying links and files between Apple devices occasionally won&rsquo;t happen</li>
<li>the same for the new Share Sheet. Sometimes, I&rsquo;d keep tapping an app or an action several times and nothing would happen.</li>
<li>when running the Apple Watch in Cinema Mode, tapping the screen might not wake it up. Sometimes, up to four or five taps were needed.</li>
<li>Apple Pay occasionally won&rsquo;t open up on a double tap.</li>
</ul>

<p>If those were all things that did not work in general, I wouldn&rsquo;t t be worried. Those I am sure that Apple would have fixed by now. What worries me are those many tiny things that work most of the time, but often fail to do so. I know from experience with the the products that I have been working on that those are the issues that cause the most customer distrust, because of being treated as <em>working</em>.</p>

<p>P.S. All of this reminds me of:</p>

            <description>If you put a frog in a frying pan, it will quickly jump out. Yet, if you put the frog in cold water and slowly heat, the frog will enjoy the warmth until it&amp;rsquo;s too late to escape.
 We have all heard that story, but how many of us can admit that we play the frog on a daily basis? Especially at work, people tend to put a lot more focus on what they are working on and rather, avoid having a say on how the rest of the organization moves forward.</description>

<p>We have all heard that story, but how many of us can admit that we play the frog on a daily basis? Especially at work, people tend to put a lot more focus on what they are working on and rather, avoid having a say on how the rest of the organization moves forward. This is all normal, and granted, traditionally not everyone has had the leverage to pull strings at the project or organizational levels. But IT startups are different, or they want us to believe that they are different. Therefore, when I see so many people in the IT industry changing jobs all the time, it makes me want to ask for the reasons. Money or titles are the usual answers, but I often sense there&rsquo;s something deeper lurking behind. An inability to admit that, just like the frog, they have enjoyed the perks of the industry, not noticing how the organization had shifted in the meantime.</p>

<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re passionate about what you&rsquo;re doing, you need to keep an eye on how things are changing around you</strong>. Don&rsquo;t worry about leaving your comfort zone. Unless you actively speak up your mind, you&rsquo;ll be forced to by the warm water becoming too hot to bear.</p>

<p>If you still fail to change things, <strong>you&rsquo;ll know that you&rsquo;ve tried at least</strong>. It&rsquo;s never too late to change the train and start again. As Martin Fowler <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganization">wrote</a> once:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can change your <strong>organization</strong>, or <strong>change</strong> your organization.</p>

            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:
In 2018, I:
 Got engaged Changed my job Started new new side projects Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice) Visited 5 countries and met many new people Read 15 books Wrote nearly 30 blog posts Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups  Wow, quite a year, heh?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:</p>

<p>In 2018, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Got engaged</li>
<li>Changed my job</li>
<li>Started new new side projects</li>
<li>Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups</li>
<li>Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice)</li>
<li>Visited 5 countries and met many new people</li>
<li>Read 15 books</li>
<li>Wrote nearly 30 blog posts</li>
<li>Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons</li>
<li>Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, quite a year, heh?In reality, these numbers would mean nothing, if it weren&rsquo;t for the things I learned in between. I am one of the people who believe that goals are not destinations, but guiding posts. To me it&rsquo;s the journey that matters. For instance, the fact that I finished 15 books this year wouldn&rsquo;t matter, if I cannot remember even a single quote to keep in my mind for the rest of my life. Same with running. It&rsquo;s not the number of half marathons I ran throughout this year, but about the transformation my body and mind underwent every time - anxiety, exhaustion, acceptance, relief, exhilaration.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I learned this year:</p>

<p><strong>I learned to embrace the unknown</strong>, get out of my comfort zone, and jump into unknown waters. I was reluctant to leave the safety of my old job, but in retrospect, it seems like I have really missed a gulp of fresh air.</p>

<p><strong>I learned that patience and persistence matter</strong>. When you look at the numbers above, every single one of them alone, would seem insurmountable, if you push yourself to achieve it once. But I did everything stepwise, one tiny bit at a time, day after day. Doing things this way is harder, because it requires a lot of motivation, but it certainly has a more long-lasting effect at the end.</p>

<p><strong>learned that people are different</strong>, and what worked for me, may not work for others. In fact, it will <strong>most probably not work for others</strong>. You cannot take people by the hand and show them the right way, because you don&rsquo;t know the right way for others. What you can and definitely should do, is encourage them to find it for themselves.</p>

<p>As a direct consequence of the above, <strong>I learned to listen more</strong>. Normally, I am the type of person who won&rsquo;t start a conversation, but once I feel comfortable enough, I won&rsquo;t stop talking. Sometimes too much. Talking is good, but being a good listener is a way more appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>I learned that being having an introverted personality is unlike what society tells us, but a hidden gem in disguise</strong>. Previously, I thought that it is some kind of a disadvantage that I need to cure myself from. So, I thought that becoming a sports person and an active community persona, would help me &ldquo;get cured&rdquo;. In fact, I had to try everything to come to the realization that this is not something people need to cure themselves from, but a unique gift that they should embrace. The ability to observe the surrounding environment with the focus of an introvert, or be able to go deep in the flow when solving a problem or mastering a skill, is something you shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of, but actively go after. If I could do something for the community in 2019, it would be to meet more and more introverted people, and share my discoveries with them.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>I realized how much I really, really love writing</strong>.</p>

<p>When I look back, it seems like 2018 was a great year indeed. Looking forward to an amazing 2019! My best wishes for a wonderful new year!</p>

            <title>I Made a Mastodon Account and so Far I like It</title>

            <description>So, you might have heard about Mastodon. A micro-blogging alternative to Twitter, boasting itself for being 100% open-source, and for its decentralised nature.
  Unlike traditional social networks like Twitter and Facebook, Mastodon is not driven by a single company profiting by selling your identity to others, but by a network of instance maintainers and supporters who put their own money on the line. Ensuring that Mastodon is going to live in the long term sounds easy&amp;hellip;on paper.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, you might have heard about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. A micro-blogging alternative to Twitter, boasting itself for being 100% open-source, and for its decentralised nature.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional social networks like Twitter and Facebook, Mastodon is not driven by a single company profiting by selling your identity to others, but by a network of instance maintainers and supporters who put their own money on the line. Ensuring that Mastodon is going to live in the long term sounds easy&hellip;on paper. Many of the instance maintainers gladly accept donations through <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ashfurrow">Patreon</a> or other means, and of course, adding your own instance to the network is relatively easy. Whether this is actually going to work in the long run, is a different question. There has been a list of alleged P2P Facebook/Twitter killers, which for one reason or another, have failed to the critical mass needed for mass adoption. I am willing to bet on a hopeful &ldquo;YES&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Being an early adopter of all things digital, and annoyed by the direction that Twitter is taking, I signed up for an account yesterday: <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@preslavrachev">@preslavrachev@mastodon.technology</a>. I gladly encourage everyone to join and follow me. In case you ask yourselves what <a href="https://mastodon.technology/about">@mastodon.technology</a> has to do with my username, this is the name of the instance where I registered my account.</p>

<p>Instance names are somewhat like email domains. Being on a particular instance ensures that one will get the entire flow of communication inside the given instance. Just like email however, cross-instance communication is an essential part of what makes Mastodon work. In fact, a large percentage of the people I follow now are not on the same instance as I am but communicate flawlessly with each other.</p>

<p>Just like with email, the real advantage of having multiple identities on Mastodon comes when one wants to claim allegiance to a certain organisation, group, or topic of interest. Say, your company decided to run a private Mastodon instance. Having an identity there would allow you to follow locally shared chatter, but also prove to the rest of the Mastodon Universe that you belong to the given organisation. As of yet, I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how multi-identity management really works, so I might have to leave this part for a later post.</p>

<p>The last 24 hours of being on Mastodon feel very much like the early days of Twitter. When I joined Twitter in 2008, it was still a very turbulent time for both the service and the team. There have been way too many occasions when the fail whale appeared on my screen, something which I have not really witnessed during the past couple of years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019/05/fail-whale.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the frequent downtimes and shakes inside the team, something else slowly started going away - the community spirit of the early days. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still use Twitter on a daily basis, though somewhat automatically. The community is still there, it is just that the bond and the friendly chatter of the early days is gone. It got replaced by incessant advertising (which I fervently mute on every occasion) and a stream of posts clearly optimised to target eyeballs and clicks. And of course, the clear statement to third-party app developers. I still remember the early days, when budding app or Web developers would use the developer-friendly Twitter API and boast with the client they developed. In no small terms, it was the developers who helped Twitter reach mainstream fame, and it is just sad that things had to reach their current state. Looks like my thoughts are being shared by the community as well:</p>

<figure>
<iframe src="https://mastodon.social/@bastianallgeier/100577435213222907/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400"></iframe><script src="https://mastodon.social/embed.js" async="async"></script>
</figure>

<p>Back to Mastodon, during my first 24 hours, I spent an hour browsing among the many available alternative clients for both iOS and macOS. I spent another couple of hours waiting for the instance to go back up after a maintenance downtime that took longer than expected. Everyone else in my place would have backed off and left, but this just raised my level of excitement. It showed me that there is some actual work needed, and that the community is working hard to put things where they should be. I can but clap in respect to the efforts that the maintainers of my instance put yesterday, in order to ensure its stability in the upcoming days and weeks. During the hours when the instance was online, I managed to set up a few friendships and engaged in some interesting discussions. It seems like a bunch fo the early spirit is back. People reply more often, and others join in to the chat. I have the feeling that conversations flow more easily.</p>

<p>In many respects, being on Mastodon feels like the Wild West. There are many open questions I have, like how to manage multiple accounts, what would happen with my identity, if an instance dies. I am not yet sure if I am going to leave Twitter for Mastodon (not in the foreseeable future, at least), but it sure feels exciting to try a refreshing look at what Twitter might have evolved into, had it not been forced to turn into an ordinary business.</p>
