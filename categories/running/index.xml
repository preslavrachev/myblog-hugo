      <description>Today, I took part in the Sixtus Half-Marathon near lake Schliersee for the third time in a row. Unlike last year, this time I started with a completely different strategy - keep it cool and let everyone else pass by me during the first third of the race. Seeing everyone else&amp;rsquo;s backs can be demotivating and requires a lot of patience and training.
   After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace.</description>
