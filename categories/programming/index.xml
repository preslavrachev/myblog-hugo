      <description>Imagine a programming language with the ergonomic syntax of Ruby, the speed of execution of C, the concurrency model of Go, and last but not least, a compiler that performs null checks at compile time. Sounds like a dream? Well, this language exists, but chances are, you haven’t heard of it so far.
Meet Crystal!
Crystal is all of the above, plus it has types, outstanding documentation, and a strong community, delivering a steady stream of new libraries (a.</description>

      <title>Reflecting on My Experience With Go, One Year After</title>

      <description>In my little more than a year day-to-day developer experience with Go, I have so far learned three things:
 I can change my entire view of how programming works, even after 12+ years of doing it in one form or another. People are blaming Java for all the wrong reasons People are praising Go for all the wrong reasons  Let me explain. This post is not about saying that “language A is better than language B”, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Panic Without Worry</title>

      <description>In the Go community, there is some kind of paranoia around panicking, as if it’s the worst thing that can happen to your application. In fact, it often is the better option. Think about Go programs as CLI applications. Would you rather crash right away and let the user react, or hang, trying to recover? The same applies to applications running as services. Modern tooling makes it easy to automatically restart a crashing service within seconds.</description>

      <title>If You Can’t Get Flutter to Work with Your Beta Version of Xcode</title>
      <link>https://preslav.me/2019/11/11/get-flutter-to-work-with-beta-xcode/</link>

      <description>You need to explicitly set the beta version of Xcode as your default one via the command line:
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/ Afterwards, getting your app to run via flutter run should work as it used to before.

      <description>The other day, I had to go over some (not so) old Python code I wrote. The moment I started pulling my hair, came not when I figured out that I could no longer understand what it does. It was when I looked at how the code was formatted. To be precise - at its total lack of any formatting.

      <title>Go is Good Enough</title>

      <description>Have you heard about the Pareto Principle? Also known as the 80&amp;frasl;20 Rule, it states that for many aspects of life, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the inputs. Flip it around and the opposite is also true: reaching out for the rest of the 20% requires 80% of the initial effort. It is amazing how many manifestations of both exist in real life. One of the big wisdoms in life - it is often not the smartest, fastest, or strongest individuals that leave a dent.</description>

      <title>Simple Immutable Builders in Go, Using Value Receivers</title>

      <description>Even in a simple language like Go, concurrently updating mutable state is like playing with fire. Take this piece of code, for example:
l := content.NewLoader() l.PageCount = 5 c := l.Load(bytes) Can you be sure that what you are loading is actually going to contain five pages? What if another goroutine having access to l, interjects and sets PageCount to 1000? Or worse, updates the state of l such that a panic is inevitable?</description>

      <description>Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It’s like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won’t teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).</description>

      <title>Good Code is Boring</title>

      <description>You have seen them many times. Small snippets of code and the question &amp;ldquo;What would the the following piece of code print&amp;rdquo; beneath. You might have tried taking a guess, and perhaps, even failed.

&amp;mdash; ✕✕✕✕✕ (@peterbourgon) May 18, 2017  I find those kinds of questions utterly pointless. They not only teach you nothing about real-world programming, but might also lead many newcomers to long-term frustration with programming.</description>
