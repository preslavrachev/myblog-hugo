      <description>Last week, I finally bought the full license for Alfred. I have been looking at Alfred for several years now, never really coming to the impulsive decision to actually buy the license. I have been relatively happy with what Launchbar offers, event in the free version, but Alfred Workflows are a whole different game. These are definitely the most well-invested 25 EUR I have put on a piece of software for a while.</description>
