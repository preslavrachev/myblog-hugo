<p>With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I’ve been following over the years.</p>

<h1 id="from-people-to-topics">From people to topics</h1>

<p>Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter. I achieve this with by organizing accounts into thematic lists, combined with clever searching.</p>

<p>If you have never created a single list on Twitter, you’re missing half the fun. At the moment of this writing, I actively curate <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists">around 50 lists</a>. The majority of those revolve around a certain topic I’m interested about, say <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/go-developers">Go</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/python-developers">Python</a> programming. Others are location based (Bremen, Munich, Bulgaria). In short, the fact that I don’t follow people on Twitter into a single timeline does not mean that that I don’t follow them at all. It’s actually the opposite - I follow many more people into many more thematically organized timelines.</p>

<p>This won’t solve the original problem, will it? In fact, many timelines must be making it a hell of a time to stay on top of each one. Well, yes, and this is where the power of clever searching comes to the stage.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://preslav.me/2018/04/02/how-to-use-twitter-more-efficiently-with-these-hidden-search-features/">previous article</a>, I wrote at length about some of the hidden powers of Twitter searching. One of the many examples I presented in my article was using a Twitter list as the base filter for your search. Put simply, the following search:</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change”
</code></pre>

<p>Will only return results that match the query <code>climate change</code>, but only within the scope of the given list. Search for the right topics within the right lists, and you automatically get a significant noise reduction. As lists will inevitably get bigger, you can further reduce the noise, by leaving out only tweets with certain popularity or number of responses to.</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change” min_retweets:3
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change” min_replies:3
</code></pre>

<p>I have saved many such searches, which I then keep open on my favourite Twitter client. I like using <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/">TweetBot</a> for iOS and macOS, but one could easily <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">TweetDeck’s</a> tabs for the same purpose.</p>

<p>P.S. I hear that Twitter is also going to release some support for topic subscriptions as soon as this week. Let’s wait and see the final outcome. Until then, I keep using the method, I described above.</p>
