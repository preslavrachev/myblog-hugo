      <description>I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn‚Äôt been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life.</description>

      <description>Last week, I finally bought the full license for Alfred. I have been looking at Alfred for several years now, never really coming to the impulsive decision to actually buy the license. I have been relatively happy with what Launchbar offers, event in the free version, but Alfred Workflows are a whole different game. These are definitely the most well-invested 25 EUR I have put on a piece of software for a while.</description>

      <description>There are certain podcasts, which I‚Äôve mostly listened to while running. The thing is, every time I listen to any of them while not running, my mind immediately shifts back to the trail. I guess, this makes me a slightly more developed version of Pavlov‚Äôs Dog üòÇ</description>

      <description>I have started disrupting the &amp;ldquo;Medium effect&amp;rdquo; by building a &amp;ldquo;blogroll&amp;rdquo; the good old way - simply linking to blogs of friends that I follow. The first ones to get on board are George Ho, Nikita Tonsky, and John Sundell. I will be adding more and more as time goes by.
With time, I am planning to add some more automation and clever aggregation of great content. I have a few surprises in the hat, but first things first, let&amp;rsquo;s build a network of connected blogs.</description>

      <description>This weekend, I moved this blog in what seems a small design step, but a serious milestone forward. I added the possibility to write micro-posts, or just about anything that is simply a passing thought, perhaps a sentence requiring no sentence whatsoever.
Not every post can, or even needs to be a few pages long, with a bunch of the research and heavy on media. Sometimes, the most ingenious messages hide in the simple, unfinished sentence.</description>
