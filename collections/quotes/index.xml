            <description>What you should see when you see black protesters in the age of Trump and coronavirus is people pushed to the edge, not because they want bars and nail salons open, but because they want to live. To breathe.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a quote from an op-ed essay by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, published in the LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don’t want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you’re choking on it — until you let the sun in. Then you see it’s everywhere. As long as we keep shining that light, we have a chance of cleaning it wherever it lands. But we have to stay vigilant, because it’s always still in the air.</p>

<p>What you should see when you see black protesters in the age of Trump and coronavirus is people pushed to the edge, not because they want bars and nail salons open, but because they want to live. To breathe.</p>

            <description>When you search for blogs now on you see things like &amp;lsquo;Top 100 Blogs.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;How to Make a Successful Blog.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Most Powerful 50 Blogs.&amp;rsquo; But what you really want is 10,000 unsuccessful blogs. Web search now suggests ideas for your blogs to get views, shares, indexed, but what you really want is no ideas. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible now to find a blog that&amp;rsquo;s not on a focused theme because that&amp;rsquo;s what search engines focus on and how websites profit. But you want the opposite, a blog that never tried to focus or even thought about it.</description>

<p>I first saw the word &ldquo;blog&rdquo; in a magazine article back in 2003.</p>

<p>It was right at the time when Google bought Blogger and made it a world phenomenon. I remember my first blog, the first time someone visited it, left a comment, linked back. It was a different time back then. Much more ad-hoc, there was a lot more serendipity, and a lot of random encounters. People wrote mainly for themselves, not even hoping that someone else would get to see their writing, let alone, make a fortune with it. This gave them the freedom to write about they want, not just on the topics that would trigger them the most clicks.</p>

<p>Yes, I know what you are going to say, many do that today still, don&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s not the same. It&rsquo;s just not the same.</p>

            <description>What if everyone&amp;rsquo;s wrong?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a quote from <a href="https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">Second-guessing the modern web</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw">Tom MacWright</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[But] I’m at the point where you look at where the field is and what the alternatives are – taking a second look at unloved, unpopular, uncool things like Django, Rails, Laravel – and think what the heck is happening. We’re layering optimizations upon optimizations in order to get the SPA-like pattern to fit every use case, and I’m not sure that it is, well, worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tom continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frameworks should lure people into the pit of success, where following the normal rules and using normal techniques is the winning approach.</p>

<p>I don’t think that React, in this context, really is that pit of success. A naïvely implemented React SPA isn’t stable, or efficient, and it doesn’t naturally scale to significant complexity</p>

<p>Here is a great <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/">essay by The Atlantic</a>, which is just as relevant today, as it was 5 years ago (at the time of its writing):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then it goes on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of “engineer.” An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are my 2 cents on the whole thing. Having seen one or two cycles in the software industry, I cannot help but agree wholeheartedly. As much as it hurts to say it, we, the IT folks are engineers as much as kids on the beach building a sand castle are engineers. Being an engineer is more than just being able to build something. It is an obligation to sustain. To build things that withstand the test of time. Not just hop from one cool piece of tech to the next, leaving vapour behind. It&rsquo;s hard, I am guilty of this too. But we can all accept it, and strive to become real engineers.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to argue with me on this subject, feel free to do so <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev">on Twitter</a>. You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev">follow</a> me there for more ramblings ;)</p>
