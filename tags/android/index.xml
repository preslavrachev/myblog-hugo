            <title>Q/A: Why Does an iPhone Need Less Memory Than an Android Phone?</title>

            <description>Note: Unlike my usual posts, this is a very basic, non-technical explanation. A friend asked me this question, and I thought I might share the answer here. You can use it on your next cocktail party üçª
It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</description>

<hr />

<p>It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting">Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)</a>. Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</p>

<p>Android on the other hand, uses a mark-and-sweep garbage collector, known from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine?wprov=sfti1">Java virtual machine (JVM)</a>. It won‚Äôt clean up memory right away, but will occasionally free big chunks of it in one big pass (also known as stop-the-world). This approach assumes that there is a lot of memory available on the device so that these stop-the-world cleanups occur less frequently.</p>

<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

            <description>Who wants to buy an almost new Google Pixel 3 XL at a great price?
Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to iOS than I thought. I will lay out my exact reasons in a separate post, but they have to do more with Google than this phone&amp;rsquo;s hardware in particular.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who wants to <a href="https://www.ebay.de/itm/Google-Pixel-3-XL-64GB-Just-Black-Ohne-Simlock-Zwei-Wochen-benutzt/183836663820">buy</a> an almost new Google Pixel 3 XL at a great price?</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to  iOS than I thought. I will lay out my exact reasons in a separate post, but they have to do more with Google than this phone&rsquo;s hardware in particular.</p>

<p>Speaking of hardware, this Pixel 3 XL is just perfect. Its battery life is outstanding, when compared to my poor iPhone 7. For the two weeks of use, I have not noticed a single moment of lagging, jitter, or other types of annoyance caused by performance. The camera, well, the camera is the absolute best on the market (the photo below was clearly not shot with it), what else can I say?</p>

<p>If interested, please, go to the <a href="https://www.ebay.de/itm/Google-Pixel-3-XL-64GB-Just-Black-Ohne-Simlock-Zwei-Wochen-benutzt/183836663820">following eBay link</a> to take part in the auction. Hurry up!</p>

            <description>I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn‚Äôt been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life.</description>

<p>Perhaps, it‚Äôs time to ditch the iPhone and switch camps again?</p>
