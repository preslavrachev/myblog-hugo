<p>I am a child of the 90s. Technically, I was born in 1987, but I spent much of my childhood and early teenage years during the 90s. As every kid of that era, I was mesmerized by early-age 3D games. During my growing up, there was no better example of what the digital future held for us, than Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation. As a kid, I only wanted to play great games, and console makers seemed like the good guys making sure we get to play them. I never even realized how rivalry, fierce competition, and trickery tactics there were between Sony, Nintendo, and SEGA at the time. This mini podcast series pulls the curtain of the story behind the stage.</p>

<h2 id="give-me-more-like-these">Give me more like these&hellip;</h2>

<p>Search engines are a great tool for content discovery beyond the simple text searching. Often, it is difficult to express exactly what we are looking for. This may be due to limitations of the interface, or our own struggle to explain it in enough detail. There is one thing, however, which we are fairly good at. Given two things, we can easily say which one we like more than the other.</p>

<p>With the most recent update on <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a>, I have added the ability to use Mixtape as a way to discover new podcast episodes, by simply providing the IDs of ones that might be of interest to you. Those who have worked with search engines before, probably know that this is something that this type of applications are fairly well-suited, but not often used for. In particular, ElasticSearch (the brain behind the whole search operation) has a particular type of search query, which allows for just that.</p>

<p>Currently, this is still an API-only feature, but it will open up the door for applications of various sorts. One particular thing I am working on, is in the form of a chat bot application, which one will be able to send podcast episode links to (e.g. from <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple Podcasts</a>, etc) and get related podcast episodes to keep listening to.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><em>Mixtape</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>A homemade music compilation (usually on cassette or CD-R) that contains all your favourite tracks. Often you give such a compilation to the guy or gal of your fancy in hopes that it will help you win their heart. &ndash; <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mixtapes">Urban Dictionary</a></em></li>
<li><em>A budding <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">search and discovery engine for podcasts</a> built by yours truly.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The 20th century marked a giant leap forward in music production and distribution. It started with the vinyl record which made music available in everyone&rsquo;s home. Then, at the turn of the century, the digital cassette recorder came to shake the game, by allowing everyone to create mixes of their own liking.</p>

<p>See, vinyl records are great, but they could only play the same thing over and over again. Assuming you bought one album per record, you quickly ended up holding a pile of records from your favourite bands. We all know that artists back then were great and almost all songs in an album became hits, but what if, hypothetically, one liked only a couple of songs and skipped the rest? One still needed to buy and keep the entire record.</p>

<p>Digital cassette recorders changed all that. Not only were cassettes smaller in size; one could record on top, multiple times over. This gave the birth of the <strong>mixtape</strong>. Decades before the playlists of today, mixtapes let everyone create and share thematic mixes of songs from different artists, and often, from completely different genres.</p>

<h1 id="from-cassettes-to-podcasting">From cassettes to podcasting</h1>

<p>In a funny, but similar way, podcast distribution still works like buying vinyls from a record store. You can subscribe manually, or via any of the myriads of mobile apps out there. Yet, podcasts still get distributed primarily as RSS feeds that you either follow entirely or not at all. Just like with records, if you like the podcast host, over the years you build up a certain sense of loyalty and bonding. I have been listening to podcasts since 2004, and there are are many that I have been following for more than a decade.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just like music, podcasts nowadays are in the millions. While I still follow my favorites, there are many more, from which I occasionally grab an interesting episode and skip the rest. Kind of like your Twitter timeline. Of the hundreds (or thousands) of people you follow, perhaps, you only interact with a couple. The rest are somewhat matching your taste, but you probably only added them because you like one of their tweets. Now you are stuck with them forever, hoping for them to strike gold again.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why I started working on <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a>. From a rough first glance, <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a> looks like a search engine. This is totally true - the search engine is what powers the foundation of <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a>. Unlike what you would get in your podcast player, the search engine goes beyond the podcast itself, and focuses on what makes each of its episodes unique. That&rsquo;s why, you would get episodes from various podcasts when searching for a given topic:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/?search=sleep%20science"><em>Why is sleep so important</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/?search=space%20exploration&amp;category=science"><em>What&rsquo;s the up with space exploration?</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/?search=future%20of%20work&amp;category=business"><em>Are we ready for the future of work?</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the search is only the beginning. The <strong>mixtape</strong> part in <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a> comes from the fact that each search is essentialy a new podcast you can subscribe to. A whole new podcast, made up of episodes from various shows, and centred around the topic that interested you.</p>

<p>And here comes the discovery part. By providing the full credits to the original podcast creator (incl. links, podcast covers, etc), I am hoping that having caught up on a new podcast via a mixtape feed, a listener would eventually go and subscribe for the podcast itself. The difference with subscribing up-front, is that the listener would have gained enough confidence that the podcast is really up to their liking.</p>

<p>One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year. Guy Raz sits down together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_L%C3%BCtke">Tobias Lütke</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. You might not have heard of Shopify, but surely, if you have bought anything online during the past few years, which did not come form Amazon, you most certainly have used its flagship product.</p>

<p>Out of his passion for snowboarding, Tobias has managed to build a market leader in online sales software. Yet, I was amazed at how humble his whole attitude is. This is one trait I can directly trace to his German roots.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Tobias was one of the early adopters of Ruby on Rails, and as a result, Shopify is one of the largest sites using it nowadays, and a major flagship showcase, together with <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>

<p>Listen to the whole show:</p>
