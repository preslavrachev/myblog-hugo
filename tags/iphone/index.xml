      <description>Note: Unlike my usual posts, this is a very basic, non-technical explanation. A friend asked me this question, and I thought I might share the answer here. You can use it on your next cocktail party üçª

Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</description>

In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life.</description>
