      <description>The other day, I had to go over some (not so) old Python code I wrote. The moment I started pulling my hair, came not when I figured out that I could no longer understand what it does. It was when I looked at how the code was formatted. To be precise - at its total lack of any formatting.

      <description>#TIL about the breakpoint() function in #Python 3.7 It starts a pdb session when the statement gets reached.
This is quite neat and might save me one or two print statements üòâ
Thanks to @FlorimondManca for this discovery!</description>

      <title>Busting the Myth Around Multithreading in Python</title>

      <description>One of the things I often hear from other developers, along with the usual ‚ÄúPython is slow‚Äù, is that ‚Äúmultithreading in Python sucks‚Äù. The sad reality is that I hear those from Python developers too. While I will pretend I have not heard the former accusation (hoping you‚Äôve already heard how well Python integrates with C), I will try to bring up some light on the latter.
When I ask the same guys about why they think that multithreading in Python sucks, some of them mention the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) as the root cause.</description>

      <title>Using Ephemeral Docker Containers as CLI Applications</title>

      <description>Docker containers have proven themselves extremely useful in allowing developers to sandbox environments and ease the deployment of services. Have a complicated service setup? No worries. Simply, describe the steps in a Dockerfile and you should be able to replicate the process on every host OS that has Docker support.
When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services.</description>

      <title>Use Dotenv Files When Developing Your Python Apps</title>

      <description>Hard-coding configuration is bad. This is one of the things that newbie programmers learn quickly after they realize that have committed sensitive information to a public GitHub repository. And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing.</description>

      <title>Dependency Injection in Python: The Java Guy&#39;s Perspective</title>

      <description>Dependency Injection (DI) in Python? Seriously? ü§î
At this point, I am expecting people to yell at me for thinking like a Java guy, but just bear with me for a moment, will you? Spoiler: I am going to mention Spring only once in this post, I promise.
NOTE: If you are already familiar with Dependency Injection and want to see it in action, you might want to jump right to the example at the end.</description>

      <title>Designing Well-Structured REST APIs with Flask-RestPlus: Part 1</title>
      <link>https://preslav.me/2018/12/02/designing-well-structured-rest-apis-with-flask-restplus-part-1/</link>

      <description>This is the first part of a two-part series. In this post, I will introduce Flask-RestPlus and demonstrate how to start organising APIs around its simple REST-based conventions. Next time, I will address the topic of request/response marshalling (serialisation) and validation.
A seasoned Spring developer, I felt a bit uneasy when designing and future-proofing a Flask-based API for the first time. I have recently started using Python way beyond my original intention to just play with data, and found Flask to be a super-easy micro-service alternative to Spring Boot or Ktor.</description>

      <title>Data Science on Your iPad</title>

      <description>This article is a follow-up transcription to a talk I recently gave at a local Munich machine learning meetup. Unlike my previous talk, this time I wanted to convey the idea of using an iPad for actively running data science experiments, as opposed to passively consuming information. I illustrated my point with a few example iOS applications I personally use on a daily basis, which I hope would be good starting points to get the audience interested in the idea.</description>

      <title>Live-reloading of Python Modules in the Python REPL / IPython / Jupyter Console</title>

      <description>Often, I would work on a Python module and add changes to it live, which I would then want to test immediately. Piece of cake! Add the changes and execute the script again. Well, that‚Äôs certainly a way, but as modules get bigger, they tend to import other modules, or do some preliminary setup work.
With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.</description>

      <title>Pandas: Finding a Row Where One of Its Values Is at a Minimum/Maximum</title>

      <description>Often, we will want to get to get a specific row, which marks the minimum or maximum of one of its columns. Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have the SF Salaries dataset from Kaggle. We want to find the employee name, with the largest total pay benefits. The experience with writing NumPy/Pandas filter conditions will quickly let us produce the following version:
sal[sal[&amp;#39;TotalPayBenefits&amp;#39;] == sal[&amp;#39;TotalPayBenefits&amp;#39;].max()][&amp;#39;EmployeeName&amp;#39;] which is absolutely valid, but is it the only option?</description>
