      <description>Here is a quote from:
@media (max-width: 640px) { .embed-image { min-width: 100%; } }   The President Is Trapped  Trump is utterly unsuited to deal with this crisis, either intellectually or temperamentally. https://www.theatlantic.com |  Created with NoEmbed     The president will try to blame someone else—but in this case the “someone else” is a virus, not a Mexican immigrant or a reporter with a disability, not a Muslim or a Clinton, not a dead war hero or a family of a fallen soldier, not a special counsel or an NFL player who kneels for the national anthem.</description>

      <description>“You can think of any web server as a function. Each time you type a URL, think of it as a function call to some remote server. That function takes your request and generates some response. A web server is a natural problem for a functional language to solve.”

      <title>[Quote] Manual Work is a Bug</title>

      <description>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</description>

      <description>Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a “skill” that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.

      <description>Kickstarter has made its position clear. It is against unions. It opposes its workers’ effort to organize. It will not be changing its mind. It will be fighting its own staff and its project creators. Now, Kickstarter’s users must make their position clear. We will not tolerate union-busting. We will not give our money to a company that does it. We demand that the company reverse its position and commit to voluntarily recognizing the union if a majority of workers signal support.</description>

      <description>Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It’s like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won’t teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).</description>

      <description>Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.” That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein’s H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan’s Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.</description>

      <description>If you wake up on a Casper mattress, hail a Lyft to get to your desk at WeWork, use DoorDash to order lunch to the office, hail another Lyft home, and have Uber Eats bring you dinner, you have spent your entire day interacting with companies that will collectively lose nearly \$13 billion this year. Most have never announced, and may never achieve, a profit.
Too many consumer-tech companies nearing their public offerings are selling magic shows at a science fair.</description>

      <description>A quote from &amp;ldquo;Without their Permission&amp;rdquo; by Alexis Ohanian
 We like to think that real talent always has a way of getting noticed. Harrison Ford was a self-taught professional carpenter when he as hired to build cabinets in the home of George Lucas, who cast him in American Graffiti and set him on a course that led to Indiana Jones. If Ford hadn’t picked up the right hammer or taken another job, Solo would’ve ended up saying “I love you, too”, instead of “I know.</description>
