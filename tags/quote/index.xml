<p>Here is a great <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/">essay by The Atlantic</a>, which is just as relevant today, as it was 5 years ago (at the time of its writing):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then it goes on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of “engineer.” An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are my 2 cents on the whole thing. Having seen one or two cycles in the software industry, I cannot help but agree wholeheartedly. As much as it hurts to say it, we, the IT folks are engineers as much as kids on the beach building a sand castle are engineers. Being an engineer is more than just being able to build something. It is an obligation to sustain. To build things that withstand the test of time. Not just hop from one cool piece of tech to the next, leaving vapour behind. It&rsquo;s hard, I am guilty of this too. But we can all accept it, and strive to become real engineers.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to argue with me on this subject, feel free to do so <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev">on Twitter</a>. You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev">follow</a> me there for more ramblings ;)</p>

            <description>With so many errors reported throughout the lifetime of macOS Catalina, it kind of makes sense for Apple to slow down a bit and work on polishing it. Moving towards new features without fixing the existing bugs might be disastrous for the macOS ecosystem. But again, that&amp;rsquo;s Apple we&amp;rsquo;re talkign about. Anything can be expected from Apple. Like, deprecating macOS altogether, and eventually, replacing it with some some sort of iOS hybrid.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many errors reported throughout the lifetime of macOS Catalina, it kind of makes sense for Apple to slow down a bit and work on polishing it. Moving towards new features without fixing the existing bugs might be disastrous for the macOS ecosystem. But again, that&rsquo;s Apple we&rsquo;re talkign about. Anything can be expected from Apple. Like, deprecating macOS altogether, and eventually, replacing it with some some sort of iOS hybrid. Who knows.</p>

<p>via <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/columns-opinions/editorial/postpone-macos-10-16-till-2021/">The Case for Apple to Postpone macOS 10.16 into 2021</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re all struggling to stay safe and secure in macOS 10.15 Catalina or even 10.14 Mojave. And since new apps are being pressed into service for working at home, the last thing we need is a new version of macOS with its traditional teething pains—especially in post WWDC betas. We don’t need any rugs pulled out from under our collaboration apps. Let’s focus on stability and security until the pandemic has completely dissipated.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>Our developer heroes have been complaining for years that they just can’t keep up with the fast-evolving structural and security changes in macOS every 12 months. A six month delay in 10.16 would provide critical time to iron out the kinks in their apps due to changes in Catalina. Not to mention relaxing stress on the developers due to concern for their family’s health.</p>

<p>The president will try to blame someone else—but in this case the “someone else” is a virus, not a Mexican immigrant or a reporter with a disability, not a Muslim or a Clinton, not a dead war hero or a family of a fallen soldier, not a special counsel or an NFL player who kneels for the national anthem. He will try to use this crisis to pit one party against the other—but the virus will kill both Republicans and Democrats. He will try to create an alternate story to distract people from an inconvenient truth—but in this case, the public is too afraid, the story is too big, and the carnage will be too great to be distracted from it.</p>

            <description>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a few lines from <em><a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520">Manual Work is a Bug</a></em> that I firmly stand by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start. Heck, they have a dedicated second monitor just for their editing app!</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>The successful engineer realizes that the earlier he starts collaborating, the sooner others can contribute. Together they can create a culture of documentation that spreads throughout the team. Thus, every project is collaborative and has a “stone soup” feeling, as all are invited to bring their skills and insights. The more people who embody this culture, the more success it has.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>By creating a culture of continuous improvement, constantly taking baby steps along the four phases, the work becomes less stressful and easier to manage. While the other reasons listed here are quite logical, what motivates me to maintain this discipline is more emotional: I want to reduce stress and have more time for creativity and joy.</p>

            <description>Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a “skill” that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.

But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.</p>

            <description>Kickstarter has made its position clear. It is against unions. It opposes its workers’ effort to organize. It will not be changing its mind. It will be fighting its own staff and its project creators. Now, Kickstarter’s users must make their position clear. We will not tolerate union-busting. We will not give our money to a company that does it. We demand that the company reverse its position and commit to voluntarily recognizing the union if a majority of workers signal support.</description>

The company is taking its workers and users for granted. If they get away with it, other companies will feel even more empowered to crush their own organizing efforts. It is critically important that Kickstarter be loudly opposed.</p>

            <description>Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It’s like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won’t teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).</description>

            <description>Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.” That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein’s H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan’s Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.</description>

            <description>A quote from &amp;ldquo;Without their Permission&amp;rdquo; by Alexis Ohanian
 We like to think that real talent always has a way of getting noticed. Harrison Ford was a self-taught professional carpenter when he as hired to build cabinets in the home of George Lucas, who cast him in American Graffiti and set him on a course that led to Indiana Jones. If Ford hadn’t picked up the right hammer or taken another job, Solo would’ve ended up saying “I love you, too”, instead of “I know.</description>

        Why doesn’t Japan excel in software as they did in hardware?</div>
    </a>
    <div class="embed-description" style="margin-bottom:1rem; font-size:80%">
      Ah… Finally. My time has come.Where to begin?In Japan software development is not held to the same standard as other engineering positions.Japan has always had a custom where every year, new university graduates in their thousands march through giant career fairs searching for a job. This is something I call the March of the Penguins - every one of them is adorned with a new black suit with a pristine white shirt.There the companies will take their resumes, interview them and perhaps extend an invitation to the next interview. None of these companies care about what you studied or what your passions are. They might perk up if they hear that you are from one of the top flight schools (Todai, Keio, Waseda, Tokyo Tech et al).The whole idea here is that everything you need to know about doing your job will be taught to you.Now I know people working at somewhat (emphasis on somewhat) internationalized companies like Mercari or Rakuten (the Japanese eBay and Amazon respectively) will tell you that this is not how tech companies hire.The sad truth is that they do. While there are enough foreigners who will stand up to being told to hire and train clueless graduates and mold them into proper software developers in more international companies - the huge majority of software development firms don&#39;t operate like that.Naturally, many Japanese software development firms have engineering teams of pitiful quality.Software development is looked at as any other skill that can be picked up in a few months to a year: accounting, secretarial work, project management, business analysis etc.They don&#39;t speak EnglishNaturally when you cannot read or speak English, the tools you use to develop software as well as the methods you use to develop them will be those that have managed to percolate downwards from English sources due to the magnanimity of people willing to volunteer their time to translate documentation and articles.At any given time, the cutting edge of software development in Japan is 6 months to 7 years behind the rest of the world.Software development is a reversed pyramid schemeMost technology consulting firms who are awarded contracts do not actually have developers - or have only a handful at hand. They will sub-contract their work to firms down the totem pole who will in turn sub-sub-contract their work to a lesser firm.The actual developer working on your product could be a sub-contract 5 contract levels removed from you.Good luck managing changes in business requirements.All this works because the people who award the contracts are as technologically illiterate as the ones proposing them. If there ever was an apropos time to use the word circlejerk this would be it.Consumers have extremely conservative tastesAnyone asking this question by now will have seen the absolutely antediluvian website designs that are still being employed by Japanese firms. (Behold the largest online travel agency site in Japan: www.jalan.net).We have actually done user testing and A/B testing with non-trivial sample sizes.Japanese websites don&#39;t look like trash because the designers wanted to do this. They look this way because the Japanese audiences like this. They like the huge and distracting flashing banners. They like the overwhelming amount of text. They like what you and I might call crass and unpolished advertising masquerading as website content.So you can either create modern designs that will bring in international attention, but alienate domestic users, or serve your existing customers as you have been doing for decades.That&#39;s an easy choice for many companies.</div>

            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s probably not too important, in the grand scheme of things, whether you are using a language like Erlang or not. While I do feel it&amp;rsquo;s under-used and under-rated, the biggest benefit of it is not in running a system that uses it. The biggest benefit comes from learning about the fundamentals of solid system design, and internalizing its lessons in a practical context.

      I’ve seen the inside of the Google and Amazon tech stacks. There are common threads that run through them and also, I bet, through
most BigTechCos.  Here and there down the stack is a lot of C&#43;&#43; and vestigial remnants from earlier days, Perl or PHP or whatever.
Out in front of humans, of course, JS.  But in between, there are oceans and oceans of Java; to a remarkable degree, it runs
the Internet. Except for, here and there, you find a small but steadily increasing proportion of Go.</div>

 “Building an audience doesn’t require a large advertising budget, certainly not at the beginning. Making something people want—something that people love, that solves a real problem they have in an elegant way—is the most effective thing one can do to generate buzz. There’s no secret to “going viral,” despite what plenty of self-appointed “social media gurus” may tell you (hint: if they call themselves that, run in the opposite direction).</description>

            <description>Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.</description>

Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.</p>

They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1127280727475679232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>then it continues:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft didn’t take IBM’s mainframe business, and Apple and Google didn’t take Microsoft’s businesses in PC operating systems or spreadsheets. And those businesses have a long half life, but they stopped being the means for dominance. No-one is scared of IBM or Microsoft today.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1127283553639604224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>I compiled the entire series into a <a href="https://threader.app/thread/1127280727475679232">single post</a> - for your (and mine) reading pleasure:</p>

If we can&amp;rsquo;t hear their soft rhythms - if we are to busy rushing about, waiting for thunderclaps of revelation, inspiration, and certainty - or if we can spot them but can&amp;rsquo;t nurture them into real advantages, then we might as well be blind to them.

Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person — or even allowing someone else to listen.</description>

This result has implications. If this research does turn out to be the way forward, neural networks will not operate faster than our own brains. And it will take a lot of development before artificial neural networks are as interconnected as the neurons of our own brains. If neural networks are going to show an advantage, it has to come from other directions.</p>
