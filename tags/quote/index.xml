      <description>A quote from &amp;ldquo;The Three-Body Problem&amp;rdquo;:
 &amp;ldquo;The universe is a hollow sphere floating in the middle of sea of fire. There are numerous tiny holes in the surface of the sphere, as well as a large one. The tiny ones are the stars, and the large one is the sun.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>It’s amazing — amazing I say — how little generics are missed. To date, Go remains the small, simple language that fogies like me can remember Java being. I suppose that can’t last, but for now, I can pop open almost any .go file and if I can’t understand it pretty quick, the chances are very high that the problem is in the code not me.

 “Building an audience doesn’t require a large advertising budget, certainly not at the beginning. Making something people want—something that people love, that solves a real problem they have in an elegant way—is the most effective thing one can do to generate buzz. There’s no secret to “going viral,” despite what plenty of self-appointed “social media gurus” may tell you (hint: if they call themselves that, run in the opposite direction).</description>

      <description>Opportunities are whispers, not foghorns.
If we can&amp;rsquo;t hear their soft rhythms - if we are to busy rushing about, waiting for thunderclaps of revelation, inspiration, and certainty - or if we can spot them but can&amp;rsquo;t nurture them into real advantages, then we might as well be blind to them.
