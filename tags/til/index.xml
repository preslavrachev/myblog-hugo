      <description>Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this yearsâ€™ winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.</description>
