            <description>This morning, a humble distance runner from Kenya once again proved that the impossible is only a state of mind. A performance, more resembling a concert symphony than an endurance race. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour marathon barrier today - something that for years was deemed unthinkable for any human being:
  This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge&amp;rsquo;s achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.</description>

<p>This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge&rsquo;s achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.</p>

<p>No human is limited!</p>

<p>To the critics: Yes, it was not an official race, yes, Kipchoge did wear special cushioned shoes, and drank electrolyte gels. Yes, it was an incredibly well engineering feat. One, where everyone, from the shoe designer and the single factory worker, through the pacers, crewmen, and spectators, to Kipchoge himself, played an equally important part.</p>

<p>And so it should be. As a species, we have been destined to move forward and achieve great things only when doing things together. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, this victory comes right time, when we badly need the good example of a group of individuals achieving the impossible by going beyond the limitations of body, mind, and spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have made history together, and together we can make this world a beautiful world.&rdquo; -</p>

<p>Eliud Kipchoge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheers!</p>

            <description>The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes.</description>

<p>Those are called <a href="https://amzn.to/2XwXRm2">Adidas Terrex Two Boa</a>.

It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes. In particular, the lacing system seems fancy, but once it gets damaged, do I have to throw the shoes away? Who knows.</p>

            <description>Today, I took part in the Sixtus Half-Marathon near lake Schliersee for the third time in a row. Unlike last year, this time I started with a completely different strategy - keep it cool and let everyone else pass by me during the first third of the race. Seeing everyone else&amp;rsquo;s backs can be demotivating and requires a lot of patience and training.
   After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace.</description>

<p>After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace. In no time, I started nearing the end of the group, and one by one, the people who went ahead at the start, were now looking at my back.</p>

<p>Although, I did not beat my PR of two years ago, I managed to beat my previous time on this course by 2 mins, and with a much better physical and mental condition at the end. i can say with a certainty that this was the first HM where I was not ready to give up everything at the 18th km, but clearly knew that I would finish the race. My strategy (start slowly, pick up later) has worked!</p>

<p>I want to thank my wife, and my best friends for the support, and for running along during a part of the race. You, guys are the best!!!</p>

            <description>This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.</description>
