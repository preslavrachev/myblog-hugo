      <description>Apple introduced on Tuesday a new line of MacBook Pros with supposedly, a more durable keyboard, and the latest gen Intel chips. The 15&amp;rsquo; version features an 8-Core CPU and up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 4 TB SSD. It&amp;rsquo;s a beast with an incredible performance:

Have no illusions however. All this power comes at a cost. An what a cost! I went to the Apple website and configured myself a top-of-the-line MBP with all the specs pushed to the max.</description>
