      <description>NOTE: This is not a paid product endorsement. I&amp;rsquo;m just a happy customer. I have recently bought a full license of GoLand for a year. The trial served me well for a few months, but the IDE shutting down automatically after every 30 minutes of work, became way too annoying. I know, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on an IDE for writing Go, when VS Code or Vim would have worked just fine.</description>

      <description>Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.</description>

      <description>Here is a handy developer tool tip for today: DevDocs
As developers, we spend a large portion of our time, searching for the &amp;ldquo;name of the function abc that did thing xyz&amp;rdquo;. Not surprisingly, sites like StackOverflow have become so popular. Yet, SO answers are often full of additional information, and what we need most of the time is a simple search on top of the docs themselves. Years ago, I used a tool for macOS, called Dash.</description>
