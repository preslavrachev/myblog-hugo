      <description>I have recently made my project Mixtape open to the world. Mixtape is a search and discovery platform for podcasts, built exclusively using Go. I decided to use Go primarily because of its compiler&amp;rsquo;s ability to deliver small, self-contained executables with close-to-metal native performance and extremely low memory footprint. It was also a way to battle-test the stack and figure out where and how it will benefit future projects in my portfolio.</description>

      <description>Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&amp;rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.</description>
