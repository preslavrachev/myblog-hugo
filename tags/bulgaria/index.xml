      <description>Note: What follows is my answer to question on Quora. I thought it might be worth sharing with my readers too.
This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but for whatever it is worth, I am going to let my mind speak. I would like to emphasize on the fact that I am, and will always be a Bulgarian, despite my conscious choice to live and have business somewhere else.
The reason why Bulgaria is so poor has nothing to do with its nature and geographic location.</description>

      <description>My new favorite coffee mug - a special &amp;ldquo;You Are Here&amp;rdquo; Starbucks edition featuring Bulgaria. From what I heard, also quite a rare collectible item.</description>

      <description>It has been almost a decade, since I last set foot in the city center of Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia. Although I fly home regularly, Sofia’s Airport is just an intermediary stop on my ultimate route to my hometown.
This time was different. My wife and I flew for the wedding of one of our best friends, and since we had a whole day to spare, we decided to take a walk through the centre of the City of Trams.</description>
