      <description>One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year.

      <description>A quote from &amp;ldquo;Without Their Permission&amp;rdquo; by Alexis Ohanian:

Making something people want—something that people love, that solves a real problem they have in an elegant way—is the most effective thing one can do to generate buzz. There’s no secret to “going viral,” despite what plenty of self-appointed “social media gurus” may tell you (hint: if they call themselves that, run in the opposite direction).</description>
