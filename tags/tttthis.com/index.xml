            <description>When you search for blogs now on you see things like &amp;lsquo;Top 100 Blogs.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;How to Make a Successful Blog.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Most Powerful 50 Blogs.&amp;rsquo; But what you really want is 10,000 unsuccessful blogs. Web search now suggests ideas for your blogs to get views, shares, indexed, but what you really want is no ideas. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible now to find a blog that&amp;rsquo;s not on a focused theme because that&amp;rsquo;s what search engines focus on and how websites profit. But you want the opposite, a blog that never tried to focus or even thought about it.</description>

<p>When you search for blogs now on you see things like &lsquo;Top 100 Blogs.&rsquo; &lsquo;How to Make a Successful Blog.&rsquo; &lsquo;Most Powerful 50 Blogs.&rsquo; But what you really want is 10,000 unsuccessful blogs. Web search now suggests ideas for your blogs to get views, shares, indexed, but what you really want is no ideas. It&rsquo;s almost impossible now to find a blog that&rsquo;s not on a focused theme because that&rsquo;s what search engines focus on and how websites profit. But you want the opposite, a blog that never tried to focus or even thought about it.</p>

<p>I first saw the word &ldquo;blog&rdquo; in a magazine article back in 2003.</p>

<p>It was right at the time when Google bought Blogger and made it a world phenomenon. I remember my first blog, the first time someone visited it, left a comment, linked back. It was a different time back then. Much more ad-hoc, there was a lot more serendipity, and a lot of random encounters. People wrote mainly for themselves, not even hoping that someone else would get to see their writing, let alone, make a fortune with it. This gave them the freedom to write about they want, not just on the topics that would trigger them the most clicks.</p>

<p>Yes, I know what you are going to say, many do that today still, don&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s not the same. It&rsquo;s just not the same.</p>
