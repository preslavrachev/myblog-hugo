      <description>My new favorite coffee mug - a special &amp;ldquo;You Are Here&amp;rdquo; Starbucks edition featuring Bulgaria. From what I heard, also quite a rare collectible item.</description>

      <description>Scooter Craze The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. üò≤ If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.
In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians.</description>

      <description>The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes.</description>

      <description>It has been almost a decade, since I last set foot in the city center of Bulgaria‚Äôs capital, Sofia. Although I fly home regularly, Sofia‚Äôs Airport is just an intermediary stop on my ultimate route to my hometown.
This time was different. My wife and I flew for the wedding of one of our best friends, and since we had a whole day to spare, we decided to take a walk through the centre of the City of Trams.</description>
