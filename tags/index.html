      Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a ‚Äúskill‚Äù that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.

      I have been using iOS 13 / iPadOS / watchOS 6 for a couple of weeks now. My general impression: something seems a bit off. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the new features are great. I totally love the Dark Mode support, the new Notes features, etc. I also have managed to get through the whole update phase without any major issues. No iCloud syncing problems, no significant battery drain, no frequent restarts, or any of the kind.

      You have seen them many times. Small snippets of code and the question &ldquo;What would the the following piece of code print&rdquo; beneath. You might have tried taking a guess, and perhaps, even failed.

      Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They‚Äôre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.

      It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:
In 2018, I:
 Got engaged Changed my job Started new new side projects Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice) Visited 5 countries and met many new people Read 15 books Wrote nearly 30 blog posts Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups  Wow, quite a year, heh?

My experience with the JVM dates back from around 2010. Java in those days was a bit different from todays&rsquo; standpoint. Java 6 was the current standard at the time, but most projects I got to work on, were stuck between Java 4 and 5.

Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to iOS than I thought.

      I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn‚Äôt been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life.

      Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple‚Äôs App Store developer contracts, even if they don‚Äôt distribute their apps through the App Store.

Have no illusions however. All this power comes at a cost. An what a cost! I went to the Apple website and configured myself a top-of-the-line MBP with all the specs pushed to the max.

      A quote from &ldquo;Without Their Permission&rdquo; by Alexis Ohanian:
 ‚ÄúBuilding an audience doesn‚Äôt require a large advertising budget, certainly not at the beginning. Making something people want‚Äîsomething that people love, that solves a real problem they have in an elegant way‚Äîis the most effective thing one can do to generate buzz. There‚Äôs no secret to ‚Äúgoing viral,‚Äù despite what plenty of self-appointed ‚Äúsocial media gurus‚Äù may tell you (hint: if they call themselves that, run in the opposite direction).

      One of the things I often hear from other developers, along with the usual ‚ÄúPython is slow‚Äù, is that ‚Äúmultithreading in Python sucks‚Äù. The sad reality is that I hear those from Python developers too. While I will pretend I have not heard the former accusation (hoping you‚Äôve already heard how well Python integrates with C), I will try to bring up some light on the latter.
When I ask the same guys about why they think that multithreading in Python sucks, some of them mention the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) as the root cause.

      Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years‚Äô winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.

When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services.

      Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years‚Äô winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.

      Many thanks to @themaour for sharing this tip on Twitter TIL that in Go, struct size depends on how underlying types were defined.
struct { a bool b int32 c string d string } The size of the struct above is is different from the one down below
struct { b int32 c string d string a bool } Why is that? Well, think of memory as consisting of segments of certain size, where, if the amount of data you fill the segment with is bigger than the current remainder of the segment, the data will get written onto the next segment.

      One of the things that I find really neat about Go, is the single-executable delivery model.

      I hate listicles, and I am highly hoping that this doesn‚Äôt become one of them. Yet, I somehow felt the need to write down the reasons why I am giving Go a second (or maybe, third ü§î) chance. To the Java developers out there, searching for a new weapon of choice, I am hoping that this will give you a bit of perspective. This is not a description of Go-specific features.

      Last week, I made my first tentative foray into Go programming. My company uses Go in a couple of projects, but although I have heard many positive things about the language, so far I have tried to stay away from it. The mere thought that Go is a 21st Century version of C and has been explicitly designed from the start to not try to be much more than that, can make everyone coming from Kotlin and Swift pull a few hairs at first.

      Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.

      Securing your ElasticSearch instances and keeping all the fun Often, we choose convenience over security.

Just spin off an instance, point your browser to the right URL and you&rsquo;re ready to start sending queries.
Unfortunately, one thing comes for another, and as we have recently seen, ElasticSearch left in the open can be a vulnerable target, same as MongoDB was in its heyday.

It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.

To the Java developers out there, searching for a new weapon of choice, I am hoping that this will give you a bit of perspective. This is not a description of Go-specific features.

      Often, the seemingly simple things can make you spend hours chasing around your tail. Like trying to connect to a MongoDB instance using KMongo.
Basically, if you have checked out the KMongo quick start, setting up a client and fetching some data should be extremely easy:
val client = KMongo.createClient() //get com.mongodb.MongoClient new instance val database = client.getDatabase(&#34;test&#34;) //normal java driver usage val col = database.getCollection&lt;Jedi&gt;() //KMongo extension method The quick start tutorial assumes that your DB resides on mongodb://localhost:27017, but in reality, your MongoDB connection string looks more like this:

      All of my Vue.js apps are being developed by proxying API calls to a remote server. This is why one of the first things I do with a new Vue.js app is to st up a vue.config.js file:

      TL;DR! Just give me the code In your index.js file (or your platform-specific index file for that matter), simply add the following line to the top, directly after the import statements:
XMLHttpRequest = GLOBAL.originalXMLHttpRequest ? GLOBAL.originalXMLHttpRequest : GLOBAL.XMLHttpRequest;  You will also need a Chrome plugin that overrides CORS. I use CORS Toggle. You may also decide to skip the plugin and start Chrome with CORS disabled:
chrome --disable-web-security then, as usually, start remote debugging from your app, and open: http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui on your computer.

      Often, I would work on a Python module and add changes to it live, which I would then want to test immediately. Piece of cake! Add the changes and execute the script again. Well, that‚Äôs certainly a way, but as modules get bigger, they tend to import other modules, or do some preliminary setup work.
With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.

      Without any doubt, Java is a verbose language. This verbosity of the language makes it easy to understand Java code by new programmers. It is though one of the reasons, why many Java programmers find writing Java code tedious. Kotlin brings a touch of succinctness in places, where even programmers new to Java, may find code unnecessarily over-bloated.

      Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple‚Äôs App Store developer contracts, even if they don‚Äôt distribute their apps through the App Store.

      Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It‚Äôs like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won‚Äôt teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).

      Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people ‚Äúwent to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.‚Äù That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein‚Äôs H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan‚Äôs Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.

Too many consumer-tech companies nearing their public offerings are selling magic shows at a science fair.

 We like to think that real talent always has a way of getting noticed. Harrison Ford was a self-taught professional carpenter when he as hired to build cabinets in the home of George Lucas, who cast him in American Graffiti and set him on a course that led to Indiana Jones. If Ford hadn‚Äôt picked up the right hammer or taken another job, Solo would‚Äôve ended up saying ‚ÄúI love you, too‚Äù, instead of ‚ÄúI know.

      Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple‚Äôs App Store developer contracts, even if they don‚Äôt distribute their apps through the App Store.

Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.

      Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.

      This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.

      Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They‚Äôre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.

      Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.

I decided to use Go primarily because of its compiler&rsquo;s ability to deliver small, self-contained executables with close-to-metal native performance and extremely low memory footprint. It was also a way to battle-test the stack and figure out where and how it will benefit future projects in my portfolio.

Basically, if you have checked out the KMongo quick start, setting up a client and fetching some data should be extremely easy:
val client = KMongo.createClient() //get com.mongodb.MongoClient new instance val database = client.getDatabase(&#34;test&#34;) //normal java driver usage val col = database.getCollection&lt;Jedi&gt;() //KMongo extension method The quick start tutorial assumes that your DB resides on mongodb://localhost:27017, but in reality, your MongoDB connection string looks more like this:

      Many thanks to @themaour for sharing this tip on Twitter TIL that in Go, struct size depends on how underlying types were defined.
struct { a bool b int32 c string d string } The size of the struct above is is different from the one down below
struct { b int32 c string d string a bool } Why is that? Well, think of memory as consisting of segments of certain size, where, if the amount of data you fill the segment with is bigger than the current remainder of the segment, the data will get written onto the next segment.

      Often, we will want to get to get a specific row, which marks the minimum or maximum of one of its columns. Let&rsquo;s suppose we have the SF Salaries dataset from Kaggle. We want to find the employee name, with the largest total pay benefits. The experience with writing NumPy/Pandas filter conditions will quickly let us produce the following version:
sal[sal[&#39;TotalPayBenefits&#39;] == sal[&#39;TotalPayBenefits&#39;].max()][&#39;EmployeeName&#39;] which is absolutely valid, but is it the only option?

      Scooter Craze The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. üò≤ If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.
In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians.

      The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes.

      Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people ‚Äúwent to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.‚Äù That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein‚Äôs H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan‚Äôs Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.

      I have recently made my project Mixtape open to the world. Mixtape is a search and discovery platform for podcasts, built exclusively using Go. I decided to use Go primarily because of its compiler&rsquo;s ability to deliver small, self-contained executables with close-to-metal native performance and extremely low memory footprint. It was also a way to battle-test the stack and figure out where and how it will benefit future projects in my portfolio.

      Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.

      Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.

      Have you heard about the Pareto Principle? Also known as the 80&frasl;20 Rule, it states that for many aspects of life, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the inputs. Flip it around and the opposite is also true: reaching out for the rest of the 20% requires 80% of the initial effort. It is amazing how many manifestations of both exist in real life. One of the big wisdoms in life - it is often not the smartest, fastest, or strongest individuals that leave a dent.

      Even in a simple language like Go, concurrently updating mutable state is like playing with fire. Take this piece of code, for example:
l := content.NewLoader() l.PageCount = 5 c := l.Load(bytes) Can you be sure that what you are loading is actually going to contain five pages? What if another goroutine having access to l, interjects and sets PageCount to 1000? Or worse, updates the state of l such that a panic is inevitable?

      Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple‚Äôs App Store developer contracts, even if they don‚Äôt distribute their apps through the App Store.

Simply, describe the steps in a Dockerfile and you should be able to replicate the process on every host OS that has Docker support.
When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services.

And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing.

With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.

Simply, describe the steps in a Dockerfile and you should be able to replicate the process on every host OS that has Docker support.
When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services.

      Hard-coding configuration is bad. This is one of the things that newbie programmers learn quickly after they realize that have committed sensitive information to a public GitHub repository. And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing.

      This is the first part of a two-part series. In this post, I will introduce Flask-RestPlus and demonstrate how to start organising APIs around its simple REST-based conventions. Next time, I will address the topic of request/response marshalling (serialisation) and validation.
A seasoned Spring developer, I felt a bit uneasy when designing and future-proofing a Flask-based API for the first time. I have recently started using Python way beyond my original intention to just play with data, and found Flask to be a super-easy micro-service alternative to Spring Boot or Ktor.

      Often, I would work on a Python module and add changes to it live, which I would then want to test immediately. Piece of cake! Add the changes and execute the script again. Well, that‚Äôs certainly a way, but as modules get bigger, they tend to import other modules, or do some preliminary setup work.
With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.

It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.

The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It‚Äôs like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won‚Äôt teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).

 Convenience is the powerful marketing tool deployed by utopian evangelists to describe a world of total ease and seamless interactions that deliberately masks a frantic race to monopolize a near-bottomless well of behavioral and biometric data. It is the device used to reduce our personal agency, strip us of personal choice, and ultimately render us helpless to the terms and conditions to which we have unwittingly clicked ‚ÄúI agree.

      This morning, a humble distance runner from Kenya once again proved that the impossible is only a state of mind. A performance, more resembling a concert symphony than an endurance race.

      It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:
In 2018, I:
 Got engaged Changed my job Started new new side projects Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice) Visited 5 countries and met many new people Read 15 books Wrote nearly 30 blog posts Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups  Wow, quite a year, heh?

      The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes.

      Today, I took part in the Sixtus Half-Marathon near lake Schliersee for the third time in a row. Unlike last year, this time I started with a completely different strategy - keep it cool and let everyone else pass by me during the first third of the race. Seeing everyone else&rsquo;s backs can be demotivating and requires a lot of patience and training.
   After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace.

      This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.

My experience with the JVM dates back from around 2010. Java in those days was a bit different from todays&rsquo; standpoint. Java 6 was the current standard at the time, but most projects I got to work on, were stuck between Java 4 and 5.

      So, you might have heard about Mastodon. A micro-blogging alternative to Twitter, boasting itself for being 100% open-source, and for its decentralised nature.
  Unlike traditional social networks like Twitter and Facebook, Mastodon is not driven by a single company profiting by selling your identity to others, but by a network of instance maintainers and supporters who put their own money on the line. Ensuring that Mastodon is going to live in the long term sounds easy&hellip;on paper.

      Twitter can be a mess sometimes. If you follow tons of people, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the torrent of constant updates. This was one of the reasons why Twitter decided to move away from the purely chronological timeline a couple of years ago. In a move that almost ditched the diehard Twitter fans in favor of the mainstream, predominantly passive content consumers, the company started pushing more and more in favour of algorithmically adjusted timelines, much like Facebook does it.

Just spin off an instance, point your browser to the right URL and you&rsquo;re ready to start sending queries.
Unfortunately, one thing comes for another, and as we have recently seen, ElasticSearch left in the open can be a vulnerable target, same as MongoDB was in its heyday.

      Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They‚Äôre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.

      Many thanks to @themaour for sharing this tip on Twitter TIL that in Go, struct size depends on how underlying types were defined.
struct { a bool b int32 c string d string } The size of the struct above is is different from the one down below
struct { b int32 c string d string a bool } Why is that? Well, think of memory as consisting of segments of certain size, where, if the amount of data you fill the segment with is bigger than the current remainder of the segment, the data will get written onto the next segment.

      Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years‚Äô winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.

      One of the things that I find really neat about Go, is the single-executable delivery model. For small projects, it&rsquo;s as simple as dragging and dropping the built executable right where I need it. After some time, however, I might easily forget which version of my codebase a given executable has been built upon. If I have to revert a change, how can I make sure that I build from the right commit?

      Hard-coding configuration is bad. This is one of the things that newbie programmers learn quickly after they realize that have committed sensitive information to a public GitHub repository. And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing.

With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.

      Twitter can be a mess sometimes. If you follow tons of people, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the torrent of constant updates. This was one of the reasons why Twitter decided to move away from the purely chronological timeline a couple of years ago. In a move that almost ditched the diehard Twitter fans in favor of the mainstream, predominantly passive content consumers, the company started pushing more and more in favour of algorithmically adjusted timelines, much like Facebook does it.

Yet, SO answers are often full of additional information, and what we need most of the time is a simple search on top of the docs themselves. Years ago, I used a tool for macOS, called Dash.

      It has been almost a decade, since I last set foot in the city center of Bulgaria‚Äôs capital, Sofia. Although I fly home regularly, Sofia‚Äôs Airport is just an intermediary stop on my ultimate route to my hometown.
This time was different. My wife and I flew for the wedding of one of our best friends, and since we had a whole day to spare, we decided to take a walk through the centre of the City of Trams.

      With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I‚Äôve been following over the years.
From people to topics Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter.

      Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They‚Äôre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.

      So, you might have heard about Mastodon. A micro-blogging alternative to Twitter, boasting itself for being 100% open-source, and for its decentralised nature.
  Unlike traditional social networks like Twitter and Facebook, Mastodon is not driven by a single company profiting by selling your identity to others, but by a network of instance maintainers and supporters who put their own money on the line. Ensuring that Mastodon is going to live in the long term sounds easy&hellip;on paper.

      Twitter can be a mess sometimes. If you follow tons of people, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the torrent of constant updates. This was one of the reasons why Twitter decided to move away from the purely chronological timeline a couple of years ago. In a move that almost ditched the diehard Twitter fans in favor of the mainstream, predominantly passive content consumers, the company started pushing more and more in favour of algorithmically adjusted timelines, much like Facebook does it.

      This morning, a humble distance runner from Kenya once again proved that the impossible is only a state of mind. A performance, more resembling a concert symphony than an endurance race. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour marathon barrier today - something that for years was deemed unthinkable for any human being:
  This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge&rsquo;s achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.

      This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.

      Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people ‚Äúwent to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.‚Äù That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein‚Äôs H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan‚Äôs Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.
