 A homemade music compilation (usually on cassette or CD-R) that contains all your favourite tracks. Often you give such a compilation to the guy or gal of your fancy in hopes that it will help you win their heart. &amp;ndash; Urban Dictionary A budding search and discovery engine for podcasts built by yours truly.  The 20th century marked a giant leap forward in music production and distribution.</description>

It was also a way to battle-test the stack and figure out where and how it will benefit future projects in my portfolio.</description>
