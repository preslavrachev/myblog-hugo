            <description>What you should see when you see black protesters in the age of Trump and coronavirus is people pushed to the edge, not because they want bars and nail salons open, but because they want to live. To breathe.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a quote from an op-ed essay by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, published in the LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don’t want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you’re choking on it — until you let the sun in. Then you see it’s everywhere. As long as we keep shining that light, we have a chance of cleaning it wherever it lands. But we have to stay vigilant, because it’s always still in the air.</p>

<p>What you should see when you see black protesters in the age of Trump and coronavirus is people pushed to the edge, not because they want bars and nail salons open, but because they want to live. To breathe.</p>

<p>Here is a great <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/">essay by The Atlantic</a>, which is just as relevant today, as it was 5 years ago (at the time of its writing):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then it goes on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of “engineer.” An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are my 2 cents on the whole thing. Having seen one or two cycles in the software industry, I cannot help but agree wholeheartedly. As much as it hurts to say it, we, the IT folks are engineers as much as kids on the beach building a sand castle are engineers. Being an engineer is more than just being able to build something. It is an obligation to sustain. To build things that withstand the test of time. Not just hop from one cool piece of tech to the next, leaving vapour behind. It&rsquo;s hard, I am guilty of this too. But we can all accept it, and strive to become real engineers.</p>
