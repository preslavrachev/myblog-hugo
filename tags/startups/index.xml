            <description>Diluting the market proposition might push loyal customers away. Though, who cares about paying customers anyway?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>In his brilliant book <a href="https://amzn.to/2TktniU">&ldquo;This is Marketing&rdquo;</a>, author Seth Godin goes a long way explaining the importance of &ldquo;finding your minimal viable audience&rdquo;. A few people that one&rsquo;s product or service can introduce a significant change for. The only ones that deserve one&rsquo;s focus and attention.</p>

<p>This morning, I woke up to the news that Notion is going to drop the only restriction that distinguished its free from its paid plan. There will no longer be a limit of 1000 items in the free plan, essentially, opening up the gates to a swath of new users, who&rsquo;d stay on the free plan forever.</p>

      <div class="title"
        style="font-weight: 800; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size:120%">

    </a>
    <div class="embed-description" style="margin-bottom:1rem; font-size:80%">
      There’s never been a better time to check out the collaborative note-taking app. You can now create unlimited notes for free.</div>

<p>While such announcements are usually accepted as a positive thing, I am very sceptical about my future using Notion. Making the basic functionality free for unlimited use will bring unnecessary technical and managerial burden, with little return on the profit margin. Previously, the free version&rsquo;s limitation was some sort of hook that turned users into paying customers. Now, free users won&rsquo;t have skin in the game anymore.</p>

<h1 id="you-can-t-appeal-to-everyone">You can&rsquo;t appeal to everyone</h1>

<p>To paraphrase Seth Godin again, if you drop a tiny amount of ink into a small enough water pond, you will get it to change its color. Drop the same amount of ink in the ocean, and you will see no difference. The same applies when trying to appeal to your paying customers the same way as you do for your free users. Ultimately, it will dilute your market proposition so much that your paying customers won&rsquo;t feel a compelling need to stay on the paid plan anymore. Perhaps, many might switch to a competitor who makes them feel as if they are a part of the minimal viable audience that Seth Godin talks about.</p>

<h1 id="who-cares-about-paying-customers-anyway">Who cares about paying customers anyway?</h1>

<p>One can feel the investor push behind all this. Notion won&rsquo;t be the first, and surely won&rsquo;t be the last company that goes the growth-for-growth&rsquo;s-sake path. It&rsquo;s a bulletproof way to getting even more and more investor money, and eventually, getting bought by someone big out of FOMO. It&rsquo;s certainly a viable business model nowadays.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just not sure I like it.</p>

            <description>If you wake up on a Casper mattress, hail a Lyft to get to your desk at WeWork, use DoorDash to order lunch to the office, hail another Lyft home, and have Uber Eats bring you dinner, you have spent your entire day interacting with companies that will collectively lose nearly \$13 billion this year. Most have never announced, and may never achieve, a profit.
Too many consumer-tech companies nearing their public offerings are selling magic shows at a science fair.</description>

<p>Too many consumer-tech companies nearing their public offerings are selling magic shows at a science fair. The unicorns aren’t doomed, even if their old valuations are. But they have to change their stories, and their businesses. Magic made them. Only math will save them.</p>

            <description>Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans">@benedictevans</a> on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.</p>

<p>The series starts with:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1127280727475679232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>then it continues:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft didn’t take IBM’s mainframe business, and Apple and Google didn’t take Microsoft’s businesses in PC operating systems or spreadsheets. And those businesses have a long half life, but they stopped being the means for dominance. No-one is scared of IBM or Microsoft today.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1127283553639604224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>I compiled the entire series into a <a href="https://threader.app/thread/1127280727475679232">single post</a> - for your (and mine) reading pleasure:</p>
