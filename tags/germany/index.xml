<h1 id="scooter-craze">Scooter Craze</h1>

<p>The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. üò≤ If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.</p>

<p>In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians. I just hope they don&rsquo;t follow the fate of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/obikesofmunich/">OBike&rsquo;s rentable bikes</a>, some of which ended up in the local river. An electric scooter&rsquo;s battery is a mini lab of toxic stuff, so if this is in your mind, please, think twice.</p>

            <description>Today, I took part in the Sixtus Half-Marathon near lake Schliersee for the third time in a row. Unlike last year, this time I started with a completely different strategy - keep it cool and let everyone else pass by me during the first third of the race. Seeing everyone else&amp;rsquo;s backs can be demotivating and requires a lot of patience and training.
   After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace.</description>

<p>After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace. In no time, I started nearing the end of the group, and one by one, the people who went ahead at the start, were now looking at my back.</p>

<p>Although, I did not beat my PR of two years ago, I managed to beat my previous time on this course by 2 mins, and with a much better physical and mental condition at the end. i can say with a certainty that this was the first HM where I was not ready to give up everything at the 18th km, but clearly knew that I would finish the race. My strategy (start slowly, pick up later) has worked!</p>

<p>I want to thank my wife, and my best friends for the support, and for running along during a part of the race. You, guys are the best!!!</p>
