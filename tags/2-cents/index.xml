      <description>You have seen them many times. Small snippets of code and the question &amp;ldquo;What would the the following piece of code print&amp;rdquo; beneath. You might have tried taking a guess, and perhaps, even failed.
{{ twitter &amp;ldquo;865159346149314560&amp;rdquo;}}
I find those kinds of questions utterly pointless. They not only teach you nothing about real-world programming, but might also lead many newcomers to long-term frustration with programming.
All programming languages have baggage - obscure features that made it in the spec but were later deemed as hacks that should be avoided.</description>

      <description>Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.</description>

      <description>Give me back my monolith    It feels like we’re starting to pass the peak of the hype cycle of microservices. It’s no longer multiple times a week we now see a blog …
Source: - http://www.craigkerstiens.com   Give Me Back My Monolith by Craig Kerstiens is something I have been ranting about for quite some time. It is thus good to see other people standing on the same side of the bridge:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:
In 2018, I:
 Got engaged Changed my job Started new new side projects Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice) Visited 5 countries and met many new people Read 15 books Wrote nearly 30 blog posts Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups  Wow, quite a year, heh?</description>

My experience with the JVM dates back from around 2010. Java in those days was a bit different from todays&amp;rsquo; standpoint. Java 6 was the current standard at the time, but most projects I got to work on, were stuck between Java 4 and 5.</description>
