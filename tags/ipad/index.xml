            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret that I have been strong on the iPad becoming a real developer device in the near future. Yet, one thing is still missing in the grand scheme of things, and that is, first-party developer tooling.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to stir the waters a bit and ask the reader community:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A fully-featured Xcode running on the iPad for the upcoming iOS release. What are the odds? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC20</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC2020</a></p>&mdash; Preslav Rachev (@preslavrachev) <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/status/1270597991850807302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>What do you think? how likely is it? Answer the poll, or drop me a line below.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a secret that I have been strong on the iPad becoming a real developer device in the near future. Certain things have been possible for years, and I already wrote a lengthy post performing data-science-like tasks on an iPad, back in 2018:</p>

      This article is a follow-up transcription to a talk I recently gave at a local Munich machine learning meetup. Unlike my previous talk, this time I wanted to convey the idea of using an iPad for actively running data science experiments, as opposed to passively consuming information. I illustrated my point with a few example iOS applications I personally use on a daily basis, which I hope would be good starting points to get the audience interested in the idea.</div>

<p>Yet, one thing is still missing in the grand scheme of things, and that is, first-party developer tooling. Yes, as much as I dread it, I am speaking about Xcode coming to iPadOS. There have been rumours about this going on for years, but the feeling is really strong that it will be announced on this year&rsquo;s WWDC in a few days:</p>
