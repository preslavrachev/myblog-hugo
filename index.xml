      <description>Imagine a programming language with the ergonomic syntax of Ruby, the speed of execution of C, the concurrency model of Go, and last but not least, a compiler that performs null checks at compile time. Sounds like a dream? Well, this language exists, but chances are, you haven‚Äôt heard of it so far.
Meet Crystal!
Crystal is all of the above, plus it has types, outstanding documentation, and a strong community, delivering a steady stream of new libraries (a.</description>

      <title>[Quote] Manual Work is a Bug</title>

      <description>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</description>

      <title>Reflecting on My Experience With Go, One Year After</title>

      <description>In my little more than a year day-to-day developer experience with Go, I have so far learned three things:
 I can change my entire view of how programming works, even after 12+ years of doing it in one form or another. People are blaming Java for all the wrong reasons People are praising Go for all the wrong reasons  Let me explain. This post is not about saying that ‚Äúlanguage A is better than language B‚Äù, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Panic Without Worry</title>

      <description>In the Go community, there is some kind of paranoia around panicking, as if it‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen to your application. In fact, it often is the better option. Think about Go programs as CLI applications. Would you rather crash right away and let the user react, or hang, trying to recover? The same applies to applications running as services. Modern tooling makes it easy to automatically restart a crashing service within seconds.</description>

      <title>If You Can‚Äôt Get Flutter to Work with Your Beta Version of Xcode</title>

      <description>You need to explicitly set the beta version of Xcode as your default one via the command line:
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/ Afterwards, getting your app to run via flutter run should work as it used to before.

      <title>How I Stay Focused on Twitter Despite All the Buzz</title>

      <description>With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I‚Äôve been following over the years.
From people to topics Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter.</description>

      <title>Q/A: Why Does an iPhone Need Less Memory Than an Android Phone?</title>
      <link>https://preslav.me/2019/10/31/iphone-less-memory-android/</link>

      <guid>https://preslav.me/2019/10/31/iphone-less-memory-android/</guid>
      <description>Note: Unlike my usual posts, this is a very basic, non-technical explanation. A friend asked me this question, and I thought I might share the answer here. You can use it on your next cocktail party üçª
It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</description>

      <description>The other day, I had to go over some (not so) old Python code I wrote. The moment I started pulling my hair, came not when I figured out that I could no longer understand what it does. It was when I looked at how the code was formatted. To be precise - at its total lack of any formatting.

      <description>Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a ‚Äúskill‚Äù that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.
