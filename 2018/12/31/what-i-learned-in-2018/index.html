                <p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. The time when you make yourself a cup of coffee, and go through the events of the past years, searching for a sign that it has been worth it. And judging by the numbers alone, it seems like a very eventful year:</p>

<p>In 2018, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Got engaged</li>
<li>Changed my job</li>
<li>Started new new side projects</li>
<li>Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups</li>
<li>Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice)</li>
<li>Visited 5 countries and met many new people</li>
<li>Read 15 books</li>
<li>Wrote nearly 30 blog posts</li>
<li>Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons</li>
<li>Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, quite a year, heh?In reality, these numbers would mean nothing, if it weren&rsquo;t for the things I learned in between. I am one of the people who believe that goals are not destinations, but guiding posts. To me it&rsquo;s the journey that matters. For instance, the fact that I finished 15 books this year wouldn&rsquo;t matter, if I cannot remember even a single quote to keep in my mind for the rest of my life. Same with running. It&rsquo;s not the number of half marathons I ran throughout this year, but about the transformation my body and mind underwent every time - anxiety, exhaustion, acceptance, relief, exhilaration.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I learned this year:</p>

<p><strong>I learned to embrace the unknown</strong>, get out of my comfort zone, and jump into unknown waters. I was reluctant to leave the safety of my old job, but in retrospect, it seems like I have really missed a gulp of fresh air.</p>

<p><strong>I learned that patience and persistence matter</strong>. When you look at the numbers above, every single one of them alone, would seem insurmountable, if you push yourself to achieve it once. But I did everything stepwise, one tiny bit at a time, day after day. Doing things this way is harder, because it requires a lot of motivation, but it certainly has a more long-lasting effect at the end.</p>

<p><strong>learned that people are different</strong>, and what worked for me, may not work for others. In fact, it will <strong>most probably not work for others</strong>. You cannot take people by the hand and show them the right way, because you don&rsquo;t know the right way for others. What you can and definitely should do, is encourage them to find it for themselves.</p>

<p>As a direct consequence of the above, <strong>I learned to listen more</strong>. Normally, I am the type of person who won&rsquo;t start a conversation, but once I feel comfortable enough, I won&rsquo;t stop talking. Sometimes too much. Talking is good, but being a good listener is a way more appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>I learned that being having an introverted personality is unlike what society tells us, but a hidden gem in disguise</strong>. Previously, I thought that it is some kind of a disadvantage that I need to cure myself from. So, I thought that becoming a sports person and an active community persona, would help me &ldquo;get cured&rdquo;. In fact, I had to try everything to come to the realization that this is not something people need to cure themselves from, but a unique gift that they should embrace. The ability to observe the surrounding environment with the focus of an introvert, or be able to go deep in the flow when solving a problem or mastering a skill, is something you shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of, but actively go after. If I could do something for the community in 2019, it would be to meet more and more introverted people, and share my discoveries with them.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>I realized how much I really, really love writing</strong>.</p>

<p>When I look back, it seems like 2018 was a great year indeed. Looking forward to an amazing 2019! My best wishes for a wonderful new year!</p>
