            <description>Yesterday, I was busy writing a data migration script in Python. Nothing fancy, just a glorified for-loopthat transforms one document (dict) into another, and writes it back. Let’s assume that languageexists only in a few particular documents. It was later replaced by a list, called languages. All the old documents have both, newer have only languages.
One of the lines deserves particular attention:
# add languages, if present, or wrap the single language value in a list # &#39;languages&#39; might not be present everywhere, but in those case, &#39;language&#39; must be new_doc[&amp;quot;languages&amp;quot;] = old_doc.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I was busy writing a data migration script in Python. Nothing fancy, just a glorified <code>for-loop</code>that transforms one document (dict) into another, and writes it back. Let’s assume that <code>language</code>exists only in a few particular documents. It was later replaced by a list, called <code>languages</code>. All the old documents have both, newer have only <code>languages</code>.</p>

<p>One of the lines deserves particular attention:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># add languages, if present, or wrap the single language value in a list
# 'languages' might not be present everywhere, but in those case, 'language' must be
new_doc[&quot;languages&quot;] = old_doc.get(&quot;languages&quot;, [old_doc[&quot;language&quot;]])
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone, who has spent more than a month writing Python, will immediately see the issue here. And yet, I let it slip in my hastiness to get the script done.</p>

<p>Where is the problem?</p>

<p>The line above would fail for all of the documents, which have only <code>languages</code> present. It would do so, because the second argument is evaluated immediately, rather than only in case the first condition fails. In retrospect, this should have been obvious, but it took me some time until I figured it out.</p>

<p>What I ultimately settled with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">new_dict[&quot;languages&quot;] = old_doc[&quot;languages&quot;] if &quot;languages&quot; in old_doc else old_doc[&quot;language&quot;]
</code></pre>

            <description>Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a “skill” that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.
  Dear Startup: You have no idea how much that costs.  The problem http://kyleprifogle.</description>

            <description>Kickstarter has made its position clear. It is against unions. It opposes its workers’ effort to organize. It will not be changing its mind. It will be fighting its own staff and its project creators. Now, Kickstarter’s users must make their position clear. We will not tolerate union-busting. We will not give our money to a company that does it. We demand that the company reverse its position and commit to voluntarily recognizing the union if a majority of workers signal support.</description>

The company is taking its workers and users for granted. If they get away with it, other companies will feel even more empowered to crush their own organizing efforts. It is critically important that Kickstarter be loudly opposed.</p>

            <description>Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It’s like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won’t teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).</description>

            <description>Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.” That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks.

<p>Too many consumer-tech companies nearing their public offerings are selling magic shows at a science fair. The unicorns aren’t doomed, even if their old valuations are. But they have to change their stories, and their businesses. Magic made them. Only math will save them.</p>

            <description>A quote from &amp;ldquo;Without their Permission&amp;rdquo; by Alexis Ohanian
 We like to think that real talent always has a way of getting noticed. Harrison Ford was a self-taught professional carpenter when he as hired to build cabinets in the home of George Lucas, who cast him in American Graffiti and set him on a course that led to Indiana Jones. If Ford hadn’t picked up the right hammer or taken another job, Solo would’ve ended up saying “I love you, too”, instead of “I know.</description>

<p>One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year. Guy Raz sits down together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_L%C3%BCtke">Tobias Lütke</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. You might not have heard of Shopify, but surely, if you have bought anything online during the past few years, which did not come form Amazon, you most certainly have used its flagship product.</p>

<p>Out of his passion for snowboarding, Tobias has managed to build a market leader in online sales software. Yet, I was amazed at how humble his whole attitude is. This is one trait I can directly trace to his German roots.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Tobias was one of the early adopters of Ruby on Rails, and as a result, Shopify is one of the largest sites using it nowadays, and a major flagship showcase, together with <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>

<p>Listen to the whole show:</p>

            <description>All of my Vue.js apps are being developed by proxying API calls to a remote server. This is why one of the first things I do with a new Vue.js app is to st up a vue.config.js file:
module.exports = { devServer: { proxy: { &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;: { target: &amp;quot;https://remote-server.com&amp;quot;, changeOrigin: true } } } };  When calling yarn serve, I get the following message flashing in the developer console:</description>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = {

<p>When calling <code>yarn serve</code>, I get the following message flashing in the developer console:</p>

<pre><code>The connection to ws://remote-server.com was interrupted while the page was loading.
</code></pre>

<p>The app seems running and proxying to the remote API works just fine, but this annoying message obliterates everything else in the developer console. Thankfully, there is an easy way to get rid of it. Simply, add a <code>ws: false</code> to the configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      &quot;/&quot;: {
        target: &quot;https://remote-server.com&quot;,
        changeOrigin: true,
        ws: false
      }
    }
  }
};

            <description>Japanese websites don&amp;rsquo;t look like trash because the designers wanted to do this. They look this way because the Japanese audiences like this. They like the huge and distracting flashing banners. They like the overwhelming amount of text. They like what you and I might call crass and unpolished advertising masquerading as website content.
  Why doesn’t Japan excel in software as they did in hardware?  Ah… Finally.</description>

<p><img src="/images/2019/08/Image 2019-08-03 17-45-05.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am fully aware that the hoops that the GraalVM compile has to go through are simply phenomenal, and I have heard many good words about the level of performance that apps are able to reach this way. Yet, as of this moment this option just seems too impractical, compared to Go&rsquo;s compilation time of mere seconds.</p>

<p>That said, the startup time and memory footprint of the same Micronaut app running on the JVM are quite good, when compared to Spring Boot.</p>

            <description>Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple’s App Store developer contracts, even if they don’t distribute their apps through the App Store.</description>

            <description>#TIL about the breakpoint() function in #Python 3.7 It starts a pdb session when the statement gets reached.
This is quite neat and might save me one or two print statements 😉
Thanks to @FlorimondManca for this discovery!</description>

<h1 id="scooter-craze">Scooter Craze</h1>

<p>The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. 😲 If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.</p>

<p>In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians. I just hope they don&rsquo;t follow the fate of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/obikesofmunich/">OBike&rsquo;s rentable bikes</a>, some of which ended up in the local river. An electric scooter&rsquo;s battery is a mini lab of toxic stuff, so if this is in your mind, please, think twice.</p>

            <description>The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes.</description>

In particular, the lacing system seems fancy, but once it gets damaged, do I have to throw the shoes away? Who knows.</p>

Once a language feels infinite, the costs of adding further features to it are no longer apparent&amp;rdquo;. - Mark Miller The new try proposal is an addition to the language that introduces a second mechanic to handle errors.

<blockquote>
<p>This is a serious change and it feels like it’s being pushed through without a concerted effort to understand exactly what those 5% of Go developers meant when they said they wanted improved error handling. I plead to the Go team to re-evaluate the data sets being used before the <code>try</code> error handling experiment finds itself in any version of the language.</p>

      I’ve seen the inside of the Google and Amazon tech stacks. There are common threads that run through them and also, I bet, through
most BigTechCos.  Here and there down the stack is a lot of C&#43;&#43; and vestigial remnants from earlier days, Perl or PHP or whatever.
Out in front of humans, of course, JS.  But in between, there are oceans and oceans of Java; to a remarkable degree, it runs
the Internet. Except for, here and there, you find a small but steadily increasing proportion of Go.</div>

 “Building an audience doesn’t require a large advertising budget, certainly not at the beginning.

            <description>Who wants to buy an almost new Google Pixel 3 XL at a great price?
Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to iOS than I thought. I will lay out my exact reasons in a separate post, but they have to do more with Google than this phone&amp;rsquo;s hardware in particular.</description>

<p>Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to  iOS than I thought. I will lay out my exact reasons in a separate post, but they have to do more with Google than this phone&rsquo;s hardware in particular.</p>

<p>Speaking of hardware, this Pixel 3 XL is just perfect. Its battery life is outstanding, when compared to my poor iPhone 7. For the two weeks of use, I have not noticed a single moment of lagging, jitter, or other types of annoyance caused by performance. The camera, well, the camera is the absolute best on the market (the photo below was clearly not shot with it), what else can I say?</p>

<p>If interested, please, go to the <a href="https://www.ebay.de/itm/Google-Pixel-3-XL-64GB-Just-Black-Ohne-Simlock-Zwei-Wochen-benutzt/183836663820">following eBay link</a> to take part in the auction. Hurry up!</p>

            <description>Apple introduced on Tuesday a new line of MacBook Pros with supposedly, a more durable keyboard, and the latest gen Intel chips. The 15&amp;rsquo; version features an 8-Core CPU and up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 4 TB SSD. It&amp;rsquo;s a beast with an incredible performance:

Have no illusions however. All this power comes at a cost. An what a cost! I went to the Apple website and configured myself a top-of-the-line MBP with all the specs pushed to the max.</description>

<p><img src="/images/2019/05/2019-05-24 06.40.33.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>7779,00 EUR?!? For a laptop? No f*** way! The price is ridiculous. Granted, much of the cost comes from the added SSD space. If you are happy to live with only 512 GB (I have 256 and feel perfectly fine), you should be able to get this beast in Germany for about &hellip; 4500 EUR.</p>

<p>Is it worthy it? I am leaving it up t you to decide.</p>

            <description>Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years’ winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.</description>

            <description>Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.</description>

<h1 id="back-to-wunderlist">Back to Wunderlist</h1>

<p>After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a> again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be <a href="https://todo.microsoft.com/en-us">Microsoft To-Do</a> - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.</p>

<p>Three years later, Wunderlist still seems alive and kicking. Despite claims that it will eventually be replaced by Microsoft To-Do there are no signs of this happening (yet). In fact, there might be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17146308/microsoft-wunderlist-to-do-app-acquisition-complicated">deeper angle</a> to the story, which is why I am hopeful in Wunderlist&rsquo;s resurrection and second life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just installed the app again and after signing up, I was met by the same pleasant user experience (and all the unfinished ToDos) I left three years ago. Let&rsquo;s see how the story unfolds.</p>

            <description>This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.</description>

            <description>Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&amp;rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.</description>

<p>Many see 996 culture as a threat to Western economies, but we shouldn’t cave in to these practices. Instead, we should focus on strategy and workforce efficiency. Companies should strive to create the conditions that allow their employees and products to succeed without being shackled to their desks. We should clear out meaningless meetings. We should allow for deep, focused work that moves the needle. We should give employees the flexibility they need to be their most productive.</p>

<p>We should work hard, but most importantly, we should go home. That’s how we win the marathon.</p>

            <description>I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn’t been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life.</description>
