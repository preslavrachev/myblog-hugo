      <title> One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year. Guy Raz sits down together with Tobias L√ºtke, co-founder and CEO of Shopify. You might not have heard of Shopify, but surely, if you have bought anything online during the past few years, which did not come form Amazon, you most certainly have used its flagship product.
Out of his passion for snowboarding, Tobias has managed to build a market leader in online sales software. Yet, I was amazed at how humble his whole attitude is. This is one trait I can directly trace to his German roots.
Fun fact: Tobias was one of the early adopters of Ruby on Rails, and as a result, Shopify is one of the largest sites using it nowadays, and a major flagship showcase, together with Basecamp.
Listen to the whole show:

      <title>All of my Vue.js apps are being developed by proxying API calls to a remote server. This is why one of the first things I do with a new Vue.js app is to st up a vue.config.js file:
module.exports = { devServer: { proxy: { &#34;/&#34;: { target: &#34;https://remote-server.com&#34;, changeOrigin: true } } } };  When calling yarn serve, I get the following message flashing in the developer console:
The connection to ws://remote-server.com was interrupted while the page was loading.  The app seems running and proxying to the remote API works just fine, but this annoying message obliterates everything else in the developer console. Thankfully, there is an easy way to get rid of it. Simply, add a ws: false to the configuration:
module.exports = { devServer: { proxy: { &#34;/&#34;: { target: &#34;https://remote-server.com&#34;, changeOrigin: true, ws: false } } } };  Errors in browser console when proxying &#39;/&#39; ¬∑ Issue #2662 ¬∑ vuejs/vue-cli    Version 3.0.4 Reproduction link https://github.com/CK159/vue-proxy-issue Node and OS info node 8.12.0 npm 6.4.1 Steps to reproduce Create project vue create my-app Add vue.config.js with this conte...

      <title>My first attempt to try out compiling a Micronaut app to a native GraalVM image ended up with a disastrous ‚ÄúOut of Memory‚Äù. After more than ten minutes of a spinning fan (on a 4-core machine with 16GB RAM) that‚Äôs what I got:
I am fully aware that the hoops that the GraalVM compile has to go through are simply phenomenal, and I have heard many good words about the level of performance that apps are able to reach this way. Yet, as of this moment this option just seems too impractical, compared to Go‚Äôs compilation time of mere seconds.
That said, the startup time and memory footprint of the same Micronaut app running on the JVM are quite good, when compared to Spring Boot.

      <title>Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple‚Äôs App Store developer contracts, even if they don‚Äôt distribute their apps through the App Store.

      <title> Scooter Craze The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. üò≤ If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.
In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians. I just hope they don‚Äôt follow the fate of OBike‚Äôs rentable bikes, some of which ended up in the local river. An electric scooter‚Äôs battery is a mini lab of toxic stuff, so if this is in your mind, please, think twice.

      <title>The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:
Those are called Adidas Terrex Two Boa. They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called Boa. It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes. In particular, the lacing system seems fancy, but once it gets damaged, do I have to throw the shoes away? Who knows.

      <title> ‚ÄúOnce a language gets complex enough, programming in it is more like carving out a subset from an infinite sea of features, most of which we‚Äôll never learn. Once a language feels infinite, the costs of adding further features to it are no longer apparent‚Äù. - Mark Miller
 An Open Letter To The Go Team About Try    ‚ÄúOnce a language gets complex enough, programming in it is more like carving out a subset from an infinite sea of features, most of which we‚Äôll never learn. Once a language feels infinite, the costs of adding further features to it are no longer apparent&amp;rdquo;. - Mark Miller The new try proposal is an addition to the language that introduces a second mechanic to handle errors. It is being introduced in response to data gathered from the 2018 Go Survey and a review of proposals that were submitted during the Go 2 proposal process.
Source: - https://www.ardanlabs.com    This is a serious change and it feels like it‚Äôs being pushed through without a concerted effort to understand exactly what those 5% of Go developers meant when they said they wanted improved error handling. I plead to the Go team to re-evaluate the data sets being used before the try error handling experiment finds itself in any version of the language.

      <title> It‚Äôs amazing‚Äâ‚Äî amazing I say‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhow little generics are missed. To date, Go remains the small, simple language that fogies like me can remember Java being. I suppose that can‚Äôt last, but for now, I can pop open almost any .go file and if I can‚Äôt understand it pretty quick, the chances are very high that the problem is in the code not me.
 ongoing by Tim Bray ¬∑ Go Creeping In    I‚Äôve seen the inside of the Google and Amazon tech stacks. There are common threads that run through them and also, I bet, through most BigTechCos. Here and there down the stack is a lot of C&#43;&#43; and vestigial remnants from earlier days, Perl or PHP or whatever. Out in front of humans, of course, JS. But in between, there are oceans and oceans of Java; to a remarkable degree, it runs the Internet. Except for, here and there, you find a small but steadily increasing proportion of Go.

      <title>Who wants to buy an almost new Google Pixel 3 XL at a great price?
Two weeks ago, I bought this phone from eBay with the hope that it will make me go back to Android, but it turns out that I am more connected to iOS than I thought. I will lay out my exact reasons in a separate post, but they have to do more with Google than this phone‚Äôs hardware in particular.
Speaking of hardware, this Pixel 3 XL is just perfect. Its battery life is outstanding, when compared to my poor iPhone 7. For the two weeks of use, I have not noticed a single moment of lagging, jitter, or other types of annoyance caused by performance. The camera, well, the camera is the absolute best on the market (the photo below was clearly not shot with it), what else can I say?
If interested, please, go to the following eBay link to take part in the auction. Hurry up!

      <title>Apple introduced on Tuesday a new line of MacBook Pros with supposedly, a more durable keyboard, and the latest gen Intel chips. The 15‚Äô version features an 8-Core CPU and up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 4 TB SSD. It‚Äôs a beast with an incredible performance:

Have no illusions however. All this power comes at a cost. An what a cost! I went to the Apple website and configured myself a top-of-the-line MBP with all the specs pushed to the max. This is what came out:
7779,00 EUR?!? For a laptop? No f*** way! The price is ridiculous. Granted, much of the cost comes from the added SSD space. If you are happy to live with only 512 GB (I have 256 and feel perfectly fine), you should be able to get this beast in Germany for about ‚Ä¶ 4500 EUR.
Is it worthy it? I am leaving it up t you to decide.

      <title>Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years‚Äô winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones. pic.twitter.com/6yzGELAyr1

      <title> Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.
Three years later, Wunderlist still seems alive and kicking. Despite claims that it will eventually be replaced by Microsoft To-Do there are no signs of this happening (yet). In fact, there might be a deeper angle to the story, which is why I am hopeful in Wunderlist‚Äôs resurrection and second life.
I‚Äôve just installed the app again and after signing up, I was met by the same pleasant user experience (and all the unfinished ToDos) I left three years ago. Let‚Äôs see how the story unfolds.

      <title>This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.

      <title>Today, I caught this nice series of tweets by @benedictevans on the rise and demise of tech giants. Unlike smaller companies, those do not die abruptly, or in a direct fight with the competition. Instead, they get sidelined by smarter and more innovative upstarts.
The series starts with:
Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They‚Äôre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.
‚Äî Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) May 11, 2019  then it continues:
Microsoft didn‚Äôt take IBM‚Äôs mainframe business, and Apple and Google didn‚Äôt take Microsoft‚Äôs businesses in PC operating systems or spreadsheets. And those businesses have a long half life, but they stopped being the means for dominance. No-one is scared of IBM or Microsoft today.
‚Äî Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) May 11, 2019  I compiled the entire series into a single post - for your (and mine) reading pleasure.

      <title>Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year‚Äôs Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.

 Convenience is the powerful marketing tool deployed by utopian evangelists to describe a world of total ease and seamless interactions that deliberately masks a frantic race to monopolize a near-bottomless well of behavioral and biometric data.

 Many see 996 culture as a threat to Western economies, but we shouldn‚Äôt cave in to these practices. Instead, we should focus on strategy and workforce efficiency. Companies should strive to create the conditions that allow their employees and products to succeed without being shackled to their desks. We should clear out meaningless meetings. We should allow for deep, focused work that moves the needle. We should give employees the flexibility they need to be their most productive.
We should work hard, but most importantly, we should go home. That‚Äôs how we win the marathon.

      <title>I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn‚Äôt been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life. Always very efficient, but somewhat boring.
Perhaps, it‚Äôs time to ditch the iPhone and switch camps again?

      <description>Last week, I finally bought the full license for Alfred. I have been looking at Alfred for several years now, never really coming to the impulsive decision to actually buy the license. I have been relatively happy with what Launchbar offers, event in the free version, but Alfred Workflows are a whole different game. These are definitely the most well-invested 25 EUR I have put on a piece of software for a while.</description>

      <description>There are certain podcasts, which I‚Äôve mostly listened to while running. The thing is, every time I listen to any of them while not running, my mind immediately shifts back to the trail. I guess, this makes me a slightly more developed version of Pavlov‚Äôs Dog üòÇ</description>

      <description>I have started disrupting the ‚ÄúMedium effect‚Äù by building a ‚Äúblogroll‚Äù the good old way - simply linking to blogs of friends that I follow. The first ones to get on board are George Ho, Nikita Tonsky, and John Sundell. I will be adding more and more as time goes by.
With time, I am planning to add some more automation and clever aggregation of great content. I have a few surprises in the hat, but first things first, let‚Äôs build a network of connected blogs.</description>

      <description>This weekend, I moved this blog in what seems a small design step, but a serious milestone forward. I added the possibility to write micro-posts, or just about anything that is simply a passing thought, perhaps a sentence requiring no sentence whatsoever.
Not every post can, or even needs to be a few pages long, with a bunch of the research and heavy on media. Sometimes, the most ingenious messages hide in the simple, unfinished sentence.</description>
