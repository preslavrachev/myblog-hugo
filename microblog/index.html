                    <p>Estimates are such a loaded and dangerous endeavor for an engineer. To the point where companies mistakenly talk about estimates like its a “skill” that an engineer can learn. But the reality is that if you can make a probabalistically accurate estimate, then its likely that the task should have been automated by some other means already.

We will not give our money to a company that does it. We demand that the company reverse its position and commit to voluntarily recognizing the union if a majority of workers signal support.</p>

                    <p>Chiefly, Go sacrifices expressiveness for uniformity.
The general principle is to favour the transparent and ready-to-hand over the remote and opaque, the concrete and literal over the abstract and magical. It’s like speaking a language without metaphors.
Learning Go won’t teach you any exciting new computer science concepts, or introduce you to a whole new paradigm of software development (for that, try Idris). But it will give you a better understanding of the breadth and variety of the design space for programming languages, at a time when mainstream languages generally seem to be converging (Kotlin is rather like Swift, is rather like Typescript, etc).</p>

                    <p>Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.” That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).
Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein’s H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan’s Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch.</p>

                    <p>One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year. Guy Raz sits down together with Tobias Lütke, co-founder and CEO of Shopify. You might not have heard of Shopify, but surely, if you have bought anything online during the past few years, which did not come form Amazon, you most certainly have used its flagship product.</p>

                    <p>Japanese websites don&rsquo;t look like trash because the designers wanted to do this. They look this way because the Japanese audiences like this. They like the huge and distracting flashing banners. They like the overwhelming amount of text. They like what you and I might call crass and unpolished advertising masquerading as website content.
 @media (max-width: 640px) { .embed-image { min-width: 100%; } }   Why doesn’t Japan excel in software as they did in hardware?</p>

I am fully aware that the hoops that the GraalVM compile has to go through are simply phenomenal, and I have heard many good words about the level of performance that apps are able to reach this way.</p>

                    <p>Apple is becoming a macOS gatekeeper too.
 For the past 35 years, any Mac developer who wanted to ship an update directly to customers could do so by recompiling a binary and distributing it. When macOS 10.15 ships this fall, the status quo will change. Mac developers must register with Apple and sign their products. They must submit their binaries to Apple for notarization. And most significantly of all, they must agree to the terms of Apple’s App Store developer contracts, even if they don’t distribute their apps through the App Store.</p>

This is quite neat and might save me one or two print statements 😉

In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians.</p>

                    <p>Apple introduced on Tuesday a new line of MacBook Pros with supposedly, a more durable keyboard, and the latest gen Intel chips. The 15&rsquo; version features an 8-Core CPU and up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 4 TB SSD. It&rsquo;s a beast with an incredible performance:

Have no illusions however. All this power comes at a cost. An what a cost! I went to the Apple website and configured myself a top-of-the-line MBP with all the specs pushed to the max.</p>

                    <p>Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this years’ winner from The Netherlands (A minor).
Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
Since 2000, the majority of Eurovision winners have been written in a minor key. Not only have minor keys won 15 of the last 20 contests (major keys have only won five), major keys have placed rock bottom nearly twice as often as minor ones.</p>

                    <p>Back to Wunderlist After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try Wunderlist again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be Microsoft To-Do - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.
One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running:
 Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.</p>

                    <p>Google will soon introduce searching for podcast episodes as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year&rsquo;s Google I/O. At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.</p>

 Convenience is the powerful marketing tool deployed by utopian evangelists to describe a world of total ease and seamless interactions that deliberately masks a frantic race to monopolize a near-bottomless well of behavioral and biometric data. It is the device used to reduce our personal agency, strip us of personal choice, and ultimately render us helpless to the terms and conditions to which we have unwittingly clicked “I agree.</p>
