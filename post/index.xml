<p>Imagine a programming language with the ergonomic syntax of Ruby, the speed of execution of C, the concurrency model of Go, and last but not least, a compiler that performs null checks at compile time. Sounds like a dream? Well, this language exists, but chances are, you haven’t heard of it so far.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank">Crystal</a>!</p>


    <img src="/images/2020/image-crystal.png"  alt="Crystal home page"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />



<p>Crystal is all of the above, plus it has types, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/overview/" target="_blank">outstanding documentation</a>, and a strong community, delivering a steady stream of new libraries (a.k.a “shards”). Don’t get fooled by the current version number (0.32.1). Crystal has been around for quite a few years (since 2012) and has a mature set of language features and an ecosystem of good libraries.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-speed-come-from">Where does the speed come from?</h2>

<p>Crystal produces fast and lightweight native applications using the LLVM infrastructure. When I say fast, I mean, <a href="https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks" target="_blank">really fast</a>. Take the fastest Go code you can find and chances are, the same code in Crystal will perform at least on par with it, and often quite a bit faster. Measuring Crystal’s performance against that of Ruby makes no sense.</p>

<p>There are no runtime frameworks or virtual machines necessary. One can just grab the compiled binary and deploy it. When compared with deploying and running a Ruby application, this feels like a whole different league.</p>

<p>Note that there are some caveats, which I am going to discuss in a future blog post. For now, let’s just say that building and distribution are equally as easy, as those in Rust. As of yet, nothing can beat the Go compiler speed-wise, but my experience with the Crystal tooling has been more than pleasant so far.</p>

<h2 id="csp-style-concurrency">CSP-style concurrency</h2>

<p>One of the things that make Go so interesting is its concurrency model. The idea about goroutines that communicate via channels is based on an approach dating back to the late 1970s, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes" target="_blank">Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)</a>. Crystal uses an analogous approach. Programs run in what is known as <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/guides/concurrency.html" target="_blank">“fibers”</a>. The main fiber can spawn any number of concurrent fibers that send and receive data via blocking channels.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-crystal" data-lang="crystal">channel <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Channel(Nil)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>new 
spawn <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>    
	puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Before send&#34;</span>    
	channel<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>send(<span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span>)    
	puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;After send&#34;</span> 
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>  

puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Before receive&#34;</span> 
channel<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>receive 
puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;After receive&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="why-re-invent-ruby-in-2020">Why re-invent Ruby in 2020?</h2>

<p>The creators of Crystal obviously didn’t intend on changing the world of programming by creating a new language. They just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181126095302/https://manas.tech/blog/2016/04/01/the-story-behind-crystal.html" target="_blank">loved Ruby</a> and felt it sad to leave it for a more performant and type-safe alternative. Due to a series of trade-offs at the implementation level, Ruby is still slower and more memory-hungry than its competitors. Despite perfectly serving the needs of a large segment of Web users through Rails, its performance puts it at the back of the pack, when it comes to other use cases.</p>

<p>The point is fair and valid. As a language, Ruby has a concise and elegant syntax for writing. Once beyond the basic idioms, writing Ruby evokes pure joy. Crystal brings that joy to an even higher level through type-safety, native speed, and extremely simple concurrency model.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I like Go too, precisely because of its verbosity and lack of idioms. When working with others on a big project, I’d prefer more ceremony and hoops, in the name of transparency and equal code comprehension. Different languages exist to serve different purposes and be used by different groups of people. The trick is knowing when to use and when the other.</p>

<h2 id="so-is-crystal-worth-having-a-look">So, is Crystal worth having a look?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! If only to know that it exists and keep an eye on it, I’d go check it out and write a few applications with it. Whether Crystal will take off in the future is a bit more difficult to say, however. As mentioned, the 99% resemblance to Ruby is nice, and so is the blazing-fast performance. Yet, I am missing the Crystal community’s drive towards more prominence. There has been a long-awaited move towards a 1.0 release, which is a crucial milestone and would surely bring in many newcomers. To my understanding, the language and its tooling are stable enough for a 1.0 release.</p>

<p>I understand that Crystal does not have the backing of either Google or Mozilla. Neither does it have multi-billion-dollar use-cases to put on its home page. I understand that fighting for the same space with Go, C/C++, and Rust is an unfair battle. Yet, I also believe that we’re long past the days when choosing one technology over another was a zero-sum game. All it needs is a little push.</p>

<p>I am hoping for the best!</p>

            <description>In the Go community, there is some kind of paranoia around panicking, as if it’s the worst thing that can happen to your application. In fact, it often is the better option. Think about Go programs as CLI applications. Would you rather crash right away and let the user react, or hang, trying to recover? The same applies to applications running as services. Modern tooling makes it easy to automatically restart a crashing service within seconds.</description>

<p>Many people ignore a particular use of the minimap - understanding the complexity of some portion of the code, without having to look at each line. In most languages, complexity increases with the level of nesting of code. This is usually difficult to estimate when reading the code itself, since the brain is focused on what the code does, rather than how nested it is. By obscuring the text, and leaving only a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the layout, the minimap might help pinpoint parts of the code, needing improvement. It can be very helpful when working with someone else code, or with a code base, which you haven&rsquo;t touched in a while.</p>

<p>With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I’ve been following over the years.</p>

<h1 id="from-people-to-topics">From people to topics</h1>

<p>Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter. I achieve this with by organizing accounts into thematic lists, combined with clever searching.</p>

<p>If you have never created a single list on Twitter, you’re missing half the fun. At the moment of this writing, I actively curate <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists" target="_blank">around 50 lists</a>. The majority of those revolve around a certain topic I’m interested about, say <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/go-developers" target="_blank">Go</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/python-developers" target="_blank">Python</a> programming. Others are location based (Bremen, Munich, Bulgaria). In short, the fact that I don’t follow people on Twitter into a single timeline does not mean that that I don’t follow them at all. It’s actually the opposite - I follow many more people into many more thematically organized timelines.</p>

<p>This won’t solve the original problem, will it? In fact, many timelines must be making it a hell of a time to stay on top of each one. Well, yes, and this is where the power of clever searching comes to the stage.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://preslav.me/2018/04/02/how-to-use-twitter-more-efficiently-with-these-hidden-search-features/" target="_blank">previous article</a>, I wrote at length about some of the hidden powers of Twitter searching. One of the many examples I presented in my article was using a Twitter list as the base filter for your search. Put simply, the following search:</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change”
</code></pre>

<p>Will only return results that match the query <code>climate change</code>, but only within the scope of the given list. Search for the right topics within the right lists, and you automatically get a significant noise reduction. As lists will inevitably get bigger, you can further reduce the noise, by leaving out only tweets with certain popularity or number of responses to.</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change” min_retweets:3
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>list:username/list “climate change” min_replies:3
</code></pre>

<p>I have saved many such searches, which I then keep open on my favourite Twitter client. I like using <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/" target="_blank">TweetBot</a> for iOS and macOS, but one could easily <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" target="_blank">TweetDeck’s</a> tabs for the same purpose.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ml6zVF.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<p>P.S. I hear that Twitter is also going to release some support for topic subscriptions as soon as this week. Let’s wait and see the final outcome. Until then, I keep using the method, I described above.</p>

It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</description>

<hr />

<p>It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting" target="_blank">Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)</a>. Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</p>

<p>Android on the other hand, uses a mark-and-sweep garbage collector, known from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">Java virtual machine (JVM)</a>. It won’t clean up memory right away, but will occasionally free big chunks of it in one big pass (also known as stop-the-world). This approach assumes that there is a lot of memory available on the device so that these stop-the-world cleanups occur less frequently.</p>

<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>The first thing I do when I start a new project nowadays, is to set up an automatic code formatter. My personal favorite for Python is <a href="https://github.com/psf/black" target="_blank">Black</a>. It is an opinionated formatter made by <a href="https://github.com/ambv" target="_blank">Łukasz Langa</a> - a Python Core developer. Black leaves little choice when it comes to configuration. You can think of it as the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a> or <a href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">Prettier</a> of Python. Integrate it with your editor of choice, or use the CLI over your code base and Black will do the rest:</p>

<h1 id="isn-t-pep8-enough">Isn&rsquo;t PEP8 enough?</h1>

<p>When it comes to code style, most Python developers point out <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" target="_blank">PEP8</a>. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" target="_blank">PEP8</a> is a good style guide, but definitely not a set of strict formatting rules. The same piece of code might be written in different ways, and still be compliant with PEP8. This is by design, as much of the Python philosophy is to leave the freedom and the final decision to the programmer. For comparison, Go follows a different mentality, where most of the extra energy aspects of programming are taken over by the compiler and the available tooling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even PEP8-compliant code still leads to arguments when it comes to keeping a unified code base. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I have reached a level of pragmatism, where I don&rsquo;t care much about style and formatting, as long as it has been standardized everywhere. This is where Black enters the stage.</p>

<h1 id="black-is-relentless">Black is relentless</h1>

<p>Black has one guiding philosophy - produce diffs as small as possible. If one expression can fit on a single line (88 chars), regardless of how complex it is, it will be kept on a single line.</p>

<p>In most programming languages, nested expressions (multiple levels of indentation, as well as opening and closing brackets) are what makes code complex. Python list and dict comprehensions can be particularly nasty to comprehend, once they go over a certain length.</p>

<p>Black splits long expressions into multiple lines, where the outermost brackets get separated from the inner content. If the inner content is longer than the line limit, the same operation gets repeated recursively on and on.</p>

<p>The result is code, which, although taking more vertical space than writing a few one-liners, is much easier to read and reason about. The fact that Black will always format your code the same way makes even more sense when working with other people. Lines diffs are the way source control systems indicate changes. Therefore, uniformly splitting complex code into multiple lines makes code reviews easier and takes away almost discussions around style.</p>

<h1 id="black-is-stubborn">Black is stubborn</h1>

<p>Borrowing ideas from <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a>, Black has close to zero configuration options, especially, when it comes to variations of formatting style. I welcome such initiatives, because formatting is not something I would like to personally spend time dealing with. If this is not to your taste, however, you might try out the notable alternatives, such as <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf" target="_blank">yapf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8" target="_blank">autopep8</a>. <a href="https://github.com/google/yapf" target="_blank">yapf</a>, in particular, has multiple code style options, e.g. from Google, Facebook, which you can try and see if any fits your taste. You can always create your own, and share it across all fo your projects.</p>

<h1 id="know-when-to-be-inconsistent">Know when to be inconsistent</h1>

<p>Contrary to everything I have said so far, there might be times when blindlyy following a consistent standard is just inapplicable. As PEP8 says it: <em>&ldquo;When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask!&rdquo;</em></p>

            <description>Have you heard about the Pareto Principle? Also known as the 80&amp;frasl;20 Rule, it states that for many aspects of life, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the inputs. Flip it around and the opposite is also true: reaching out for the rest of the 20% requires 80% of the initial effort. It is amazing how many manifestations of both exist in real life. One of the big wisdoms in life - it is often not the smartest, fastest, or strongest individuals that leave a dent.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a>? Also known as the <em><sup>80</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> Rule</em>, it states that for many aspects of life, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the inputs. Flip it around and the opposite is also true: reaching out for the rest of the 20% requires 80% of the initial effort. It is amazing how many manifestations of both exist in real life. One of the big wisdoms in life - it is often not the smartest, fastest, or strongest individuals that leave a dent. It is the ones pragmatic enough to achieve the 80% with 20% of the effort and energy spent.</p>

<p>The slight deviation aside, the same very much applies to the Go programming language. It is just good enough. Go won&rsquo;t win the category of language design, neither is it the fastest one on the market. Nor is it the safest member of the bunch. The truth is, what Go offers on the table might seem pretty boring at first. It is a compiled, statically typed language with an extremely reduced syntax, a somewhat simplified concurrency model, and a bit of memory safety. Nothing near close to the speed of C, the beauty of Ruby or the dogmatic memory management of Rust.</p>

<p>And this is what makes Go succeed. It does not have any of those things, but it is simple and fast enough to get you going on a new project without having to second-guess your approach every second. The lack of features helps reduce the cognitive burden on both the programmer and the compiler. The speed, file-size and memory consumption of the final applications is more optimal than those of 80% of applications built using other technologies.</p>

<p>Will Go ever be the best in any single programming language category? Probably no. Is it good enough to sustain 80% of your programming efforts? Absolutely!</p>

      The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity)[1][2] states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.[3] Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first work, Cours d&#39;économie politique. In it, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.</div>

</div>


<p>This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge&rsquo;s achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.</p>

<p>No human is limited!</p>

<p>To the critics: Yes, it was not an official race, yes, Kipchoge did wear special cushioned shoes, and drank electrolyte gels. Yes, it was an incredibly well engineering feat. One, where everyone, from the shoe designer and the single factory worker, through the pacers, crewmen, and spectators, to Kipchoge himself, played an equally important part.</p>

<p>And so it should be. As a species, we have been destined to move forward and achieve great things only when doing things together. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, this victory comes right time, when we badly need the good example of a group of individuals achieving the impossible by going beyond the limitations of body, mind, and spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have made history together, and together we can make this world a beautiful world.&rdquo; -</p>

<p>Eliud Kipchoge</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<h2 id="give-me-more-like-these">Give me more like these&hellip;</h2>

<p>Search engines are a great tool for content discovery beyond the simple text searching. Often, it is difficult to express exactly what we are looking for. This may be due to limitations of the interface, or our own struggle to explain it in enough detail. There is one thing, however, which we are fairly good at. Given two things, we can easily say which one we like more than the other.</p>

<p>With the most recent update on <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/" target="_blank">Mixtape</a>, I have added the ability to use Mixtape as a way to discover new podcast episodes, by simply providing the IDs of ones that might be of interest to you. Those who have worked with search engines before, probably know that this is something that this type of applications are fairly well-suited, but not often used for. In particular, ElasticSearch (the brain behind the whole search operation) has a particular type of search query, which allows for just that.</p>

and returns the results. The user controls the input documents, how the terms
should be selected and how the query is formed.</div>

<p>Currently, this is still an API-only feature, but it will open up the door for applications of various sorts. One particular thing I am working on, is in the form of a chat bot application, which one will be able to send podcast episode links to (e.g. from <a href="https://overcast.fm/" target="_blank">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>, etc) and get related podcast episodes to keep listening to.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
