            <description>Yes, the current situation sucks. Big time. It&amp;rsquo;s not good for anyone. Least of all, for the ones fighting for their lives, and those, doing their best to bring things back to normal. It needs patience and coordinated effort, but we&amp;rsquo;ll make it through, sooner or later. Patience and perseverance are hard, I know, but those are what has kept humanity moving forward. They would do so, for generations to come.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the current situation sucks. Big time. It&rsquo;s not good for anyone. Least of all, for the ones fighting for their lives, and those, doing their best to bring things back to normal. It needs patience and coordinated effort, but we&rsquo;ll make it through, sooner or later. Patience and perseverance are hard, I know, but those are what has kept humanity moving forward. They would do so, for generations to come. Also, the ability to adapt to a constantly changing environment.</p>

<p>I keep seeing people I follow, express disappointment with the current situation in social media. Not so much because of fear. More, because the measures to curb the outbreak, push people to step away from the comfort zone. As individuals, we have grown to protect what&rsquo;s perceive as ours so much, that the mere act of doing something for the common good can cause a backlash.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a secret. This isn&rsquo;t the first, and won&rsquo;t be the last time that society faces a test of this kind. In markets, such phenomena are known as &ldquo;corrections&rdquo;. A very long upward run ends up with a shard downward move, only to start going up again. So is life. It has ups and downs. The general rule for living life is this: enjoy it while you&rsquo;re up, but keep in mind that there will be a day when you&rsquo;ll be down again. Also, don&rsquo;t give up hope when you&rsquo;re down. You&rsquo;ll be up again soon enough.</p>

<p>The best we can do now (besides personal hygiene) is to swallow any pride and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/" target="_blank">distance one another from social gatherings</a> for some time. Whoever can study or work remotely, <strong>must absolutely do so</strong>. This isn&rsquo;t a time to show heroism at school, or at work, because frankly, none of this actually matters. What matters is that the lives of others are above petty profits. Plus, social distancing is not about locking oneself down completely. Regular walking, and doing sports in the open are more than welcome. I personally keep my distance running routing. Only, not in places with lots of other people.</p>

<p>Moments like now are good for a reassessment of priorities, and for questioning the Status Quo. They confront the Old with the New, and put to the test much of what society takes for granted. As a technologist, I can&rsquo;t help but ask myself a few questions. For instance, whether information technology really stands up to the promise of making our lives better. Whether solutions &ldquo;powered by AI&rdquo; can help us solve the difficult problems in life, or just drive up product sales. Whether &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; is what they really are, or simply, an individual&rsquo;s pipe dream. Whether &ldquo;remote work&rdquo; was ever going to be the future, or just an employee perk for a privileged class of the workforce. Whether media omnipresence does us any good, or helps dig the trap deeper.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Not many have found a positive answer by now.</p>

<p>Keep being strong and healthy!</p>

            <description>My foray into Elixir brought forward many more similarities between it and Go, than I originally expected. One of them is how both handle concurrency. With respect to that, creating Elixir-style stateful actors in Go is surprisingly easy. Answering the question, whether one needs them, or can make use of them, I’d leave to the user. If you approach me back saying that the same thing can be achieved using a channel or a map with sync.</description>

<p>My foray into <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elixir</a> brought forward many more similarities between it and Go, than I originally expected. One of them is how both handle concurrency. With respect to that, creating Elixir-style stateful actors in Go is surprisingly easy. Answering the question, whether one needs them, or can make use of them, I’d leave to the user. If you approach me back saying that the same thing can be achieved using a channel or a map with <code>sync.Mutex</code> slapped on it, you’d be (almost) right. Yet, it’s worth exploring different ways of thinking.</p>

<h1 id="a-10-000-foot-view-of-elixir">A 10.000-foot view of Elixir</h1>

<p>For those not aware of it, Elixir is a functional language. Everything runs inside an immutable function scope, and no state remains on the table. A function can only work on what it has been fed with. Functions reside inside modules and are being executed inside Erlang processes.</p>

<p>Technical differences aside, you can think of processes as the equivalent of Go’s goroutines. A function chain call runs inside a process/goroutine. When the outermost function returns, the process/goroutine ends. A process/goroutine can spawn other processes/goroutines to achieve concurrent execution of tasks. Go synchronizes over channels while Elixir over a message inbox that is built into every process. Using the built-in receive keyword, a function’s execution blocks inside a process, until a certain type of message gets received</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">receive do
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Don&#39;t get too caught up on the Elixir syntax.</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># For now, it is only important to know that :message_a is equivalent</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># to a string with the value of &#34;message_a&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Those are called &#34;atoms&#34; and are quite often used in Ruby-like laguages</span>
    {<span style="color:#e6db74">:message_a</span>, msg} <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>
        do_something_with(msg)
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Fundamentally, this is the same as having a <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/rZkdET2ZhJl" target="_blank">goroutine block its execution waiting on a channel</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#66d9ef">type</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> {
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">val</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>
}

<span style="color:#a6e22e">msgStream</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> make(<span style="color:#66d9ef">chan</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span>)

<span style="color:#66d9ef">go</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">chan</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span>) {
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">out</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span>{<span style="color:#a6e22e">val</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello world&#34;</span>}
}(<span style="color:#a6e22e">msgStream</span>)

<span style="color:#a6e22e">msg</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">msgStream</span>
<span style="color:#a6e22e">fmt</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Printf</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;%+v&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">msg</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Whether you are waiting on a message to arrive in your inbox, or explicitly set a blocking channel as a communication mechanism, to me, it describes the same paradigm.</p>

<h1 id="turn-goroutines-into-stateful-actors">Turn goroutines into stateful actors</h1>

<p>Clear until now? Alright. Let’s move on. I already mentioned that Elixir is a functional language. Everything that gets passed to a function is immutable, and the only way to change it, is to return a new version of it. This means that looping constructs are not possible, since it would imply modifying and keeping track of a counter variable. The way functional languages achieve the effect of looping is through recursion (or to be more precise tail recursion):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">def loop(<span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>) do
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Elixir uses pattern-matching when choosing which function to call.</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># In our case, as soon as its gets a count == 5, it will stop the loop</span>
    <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
end

def loop(count) do
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Just print the count, but use pipes (|&gt;)</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># instead of wrapping in a function call -&gt; IO.puts(count)</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Pipes totally save the day, when you have multiple call chains</span>
    count
    <span style="color:#f92672">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">IO</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>puts()

    loop(count <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
end</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="from-recursion-to-actors">From recursion to actors</h2>

<p>What if we take this recursion example and think of it as a never-ending loop. The first call to the function sets the initial state, and the function keeps calling itself ad-infinitum.</p>

<p>Now, this is where the purely functional paradigm breaks. We already learned that Erlang allows for other processes to communicate to us. This means that if our never ending recursive function receives a message from the outside, it can use its payload to call itself with a modified version of its initial state. Keeping in mind that receiving a message is a blocking operation, the process will simply linger around, not using any CPU resources, until our the right message arrives.</p>

<p>We can use the same messaging paradigm to poke inside the state of our never-ending function. Since it runs inside a separate process, the only way to do that is to send an appropriate message to it, pass our current process’ ID (PID) and let it send us a message back.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#a6e22e">Calculator</span> do
    def start do
    <span style="color:#75715e"># creates a separate process with its own internal state</span>
    spawn(fn <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span> loop(<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>) end)
    end

    defp loop(current_value) do
    new_value <span style="color:#f92672">=</span>
        receive do
        <span style="color:#75715e"># with this type of message, we can fetch the state of our calculator</span>
        {<span style="color:#e6db74">:get</span>, caller_pid} <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>
            send(caller_pid, {<span style="color:#e6db74">:response</span>, current_value})
            current_value

        <span style="color:#75715e"># with this type of message, we can modify the state of our calculator</span>
        {<span style="color:#e6db74">:add</span>, value} <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>
            current_value <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> value
        end

    loop(new_value)
    end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test our calculator process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span style="color:#a6e22e">CalculatorTest</span> do
    def test_calculator do
    calc_pid <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Calculator</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>start()

        <span style="color:#75715e"># Like `receive`, `send` is built-in and take a PID, as well as a message</span>
        <span style="color:#75715e"># self() returns the process id (PID) of the current process</span>
        <span style="color:#75715e"># Like in Go, every piece of Elixir/Erlang code runs in a process</span>
    send(calc_pid, {<span style="color:#e6db74">:get</span>, self()})

        <span style="color:#75715e"># `receive` will block, until we receive a message,</span>
        <span style="color:#75715e"># that matches the expected pattern - {:response, value}</span>
    receive do
        {<span style="color:#e6db74">:response</span>, value} <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>
        value <span style="color:#f92672">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">IO</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>puts()
    end

    send(calc_pid, {<span style="color:#e6db74">:add</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span>})

    send(calc_pid, {<span style="color:#e6db74">:get</span>, self()})

    receive do
        {<span style="color:#e6db74">:response</span>, value} <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>
        value <span style="color:#f92672">|&gt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">IO</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>puts()
    end
    end
end</code></pre></div>
<p>In essence, our never-ending function becomes what Elixir calls a stateful server process, an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="_blank">Actor model</a>. Actors are great for isolating critical state and allowing for concurrent communication to it, ensuring that only one change happens at a time.</p>

<h2 id="from-elixir-to-go">From Elixir to Go</h2>

<p>Ok now that we know how things work in Elixir land, achieving the same thing on Go is super straightforward.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>() {

        }
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>One thing to note is that since we can use an infinite-loop, we should just use that, especially, since based on my knowledge Go is not particularly optimized for long-cycle recursion. But the main premise remains the same. A function gets called with some initial state and returns a channel. The function starts an endless loop, blocking on the channel. If we push a value to that channel, the function will take it, update the state and block again.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-actors-good-for">What are actors good for?</h1>

<h2 id="private-state">Private state</h2>

<p>So, now that we unveiled the mystery behind actors, it’s a good point to discuss what they might be useful for.</p>

<p>One thing that immediately comes to mind, is achieving globally accessible, but truly private, synchronized state. This is currently achieved with the use of channels, <code>sync.Mutex</code>, or the new <code>sync.Map</code>.</p>

}</code></pre></div>
<p>The fragility of this approach comes from the fact that there is no real private state in Go applications. The map we named <code>internal</code> in the above example is only protected from outside access. Any piece of code inside the same package as our <code>SynchronizedMap</code> can freely access and modify its internals, leading to unexpected consequences. While this shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern in most cases, it&rsquo;s definitely good to keep in mind for special cases.</p>

<h2 id="stateful-autonomous-agents">Stateful autonomous agents</h2>

<p>Where the Actor model shines is the orchestration of systems of Actor instances - autonomous agents. Each Actor instance is able to change its state, reacting to the messages sent to it. Actor instances can easily spawn other Actor instances, which only the creating actors (supervisors) have control over (private state, remember). Supervisors can also take over failures of the actors their are responsible for, potentially, killing some off, and restarting them with a clean state. Taking this example to extremes, groroutines being fairly cheap, one can easily imagine a swarm of thousands of Actor instances, in a deeply nested hierarchy, with multiple levels of supervising actors taking over their &ldquo;progeny&rdquo;. This is the unique selling proposition of Erlang, but as I hope to have demonstrated, could be replicated in Go too.</p>

<p>As discussed in the beginning, I would leave the discussions about this approach&rsquo;s practicality, as well as its other applications to the reader. I would love to hear your thoughts. Do not hesitate to drop me a comment, or start a new discussion.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Have you heard of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill" target="_blank">Adam Tornhill</a>&rsquo;s work? If not, I highly recommend that you set some time aside and check out <em><a href="https://amzn.to/32DM1G9" target="_blank">Your Code as a Crime Scene</a></em> or <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2vtbjdR" target="_blank">Software DEsign X-Rays</a></em>. In both books, the author dives into a bit of an unexplored territory - looking at the evolution of a codebase as a factor of its changes over time.</p>

<p>Much of the tooling we use to mitigate tech debt is preventive. Compilers, linters, static analysis tools, etc. All trying to prevent developers from checking in code, which might cause problems in the future. What all of these fail to catch, is that the code might be perfectly fine, and still not lead to a well functioning system.</p>

<p>The process of software development is as much about <em>developer-to-self</em> and <em>developer-to-others</em> interaction, as much as it is about making the machine do certain things. This interaction can only be let to grow, and reflected upon at certain periods of time. And what better tool to help us do that, than the one we use on a daily basis - git.</p>

<h2 id="git-to-the-rescue">Git to the rescue</h2>

<p>In his books, Tornhill discuses multiple evolutions on the same basic idea - files that change often (with some exceptions) tend to be the ones where most issues occur, hence the need to change. We rarely think of this simple fact when we work on the same project for a long period of time. Yet, when on-boarding a new team member, looking up an unknown piece of code, or simply, retrospecting over your code, such knowledge can be invaluable.</p>

<p>The code is surprisingly simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git log --format<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>format: --name-only | egrep -v <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;^$&#39;</span> | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -10</code></pre></div>
<p>What I like to do is add such commands to my list of git aliases. Open up your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file and add the following two lines to the <code>[Aliases]</code>section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">code-changes <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;!git log --format=format: --name-only | egrep -v &#39;^</span>$<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39; | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -10&#34;</span>
cc <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;!git code-changes&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What this will do, is sort the files in your project by their number of changes, and take the first 10. Those are the ones where most changes have occurred over time, consequently there is a higher chance that those will require the most changes in the future.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do an example. I chose (completely by accident) to look at Gorm, one of the popular Go ORMs. These are the top 10 files that appear at the time of this writing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#ae81ff">272</span> main.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">246</span> scope.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">208</span> README.md
<span style="color:#ae81ff">155</span> scope_private.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">117</span> main_test.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">116</span> gorm_test.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">105</span> model_struct.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">97</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">81</span> model.go
<span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span> utils.go</code></pre></div>
<p>Excluding the <code>README.md</code> file, one can clearly see some dominance of certain files over others. Many Go projects start out from a single <code>main.go</code> file, and with time, logic phases out to other files and packages. In our case, this is certainly not the case. Gorm &rsquo;s <code>main.go</code> is one big chunk of code, which can easily get split into two or more files, especially, since multiple files can share the same Go package.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go into more details on Adam Tornhil&rsquo;s work. There&rsquo;s even more interesting stuff, like identifying which files get changed together, etc. For now, take this simple trick and try to use it on the projects you&rsquo;re working on, or the libraries you frequently work with.</p>

<p>What do you see?</p>

            <description>iEx (Elixir&amp;rsquo;s interactive shell) is pure dope! It helped bring my development efforts back to the &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s play and see what happens&amp;rdquo; level. Since Elixir modules are stateless and made up of pure functions, reloading a module is as easy as calling r MyModule inside iEx. During development, I&amp;rsquo;d try to keep one module called Demo, or Scratch, etc, where I&amp;rsquo;d do the quick and dirty setting up of things. This scratch module would usually have one function only, called demo or run.</description>

During development, I&rsquo;d try to keep one module called <code>Demo</code>, or <code>Scratch</code>, etc, where I&rsquo;d do the quick and dirty setting up of things. This scratch module would usually have one function only, called <code>demo</code> or <code>run</code>. This is what I call in iex. The rest I do in the respective modules, which I reload after every change.</p>

<p>At work, I get to work with Python a lot and one of the things I love there is <a href="https://ipython.org/" target="_blank">iPython</a>. It&rsquo;s such a strong REPL that I would often try and get my hands dirty there, before formalizing into code/test. In Python <a href="https://preslav.me/2018/04/22/live-reloading-of-python-modules/" target="_blank">module reloads are not always trivial</a>, however. This is where Elixir&rsquo;s functional, &ldquo;share-nothing&rdquo; nature steps up the game. It&rsquo;s easy to reload modules that have essentially no state.</p>

            <description>Yes, the Elixir. I’ve decided to use the cold February weather, as well as the relative project calm, and see how far I can go with it.
But why Elixir and why just now? There are a few reasons. Actually, this is not my first encounter with the language or the Erlang/BEAM ecosystem. About a year ago, a colleague at work and I started doing lunch break walks, in which we discussed tech topics, beyond the scope of our current projects.</description>

<p>Yes, the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elixir</a>. I’ve decided to use the cold February weather, as well as the relative project calm, and see how far I can go with it.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-elixir-and-why-just-now">But why Elixir and why just now?</h2>

<p>There are a few reasons. Actually, this is not my first encounter with the language or the Erlang/BEAM ecosystem. About a year ago, a colleague at work and I started doing lunch break walks, in which we discussed tech topics, beyond the scope of our current projects. My colleague is a big Elixir fan and has mentioned many times the advantages of Erlang and the BEAM VM. More than anything else, one thing struck me the most. All of the challenges that the cloud community of today is trying to tackle, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>resilience</li>
<li>scalabiltiy</li>
<li>distribution</li>
<li>deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>etc, have already been thought about, and solved by a research group at Ericsson around three decades ago (albeit, at a smaller scale). Sure, Erlang is not an easy language to work with, but thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim" target="_blank">José Valim</a> and his work on Elixir, it wouldn’t even be necessary. So, about a year back, I took my first plunge.</p>

<h2 id="that-s-not-for-me">That’s not for me</h2>

<p>I got out of the water just as quickly as I got in there. Sure, Elixir is not nearly as obscure as Erlang, but it can be a bit overwhelming for the newcomer. Especially, if one is trying to swallow the whole OTP bit at the same time. At the time, I had discovered the simplistic philosophy of Golang, and despite all the alleged advantages, Elixir seemed way too much overhead. I (in)famously dismissed the language, as one where “the amount of punctuation might give you a headache”. Let alone the fact that similar to Java applications, Elixir ones also need the entire kitchen sink to be in place for an application to run. Compare this to a statically-bound Go app that you just throw onto a machine and you are good to go.</p>

<h2 id="crystal-enters-the-stage">Crystal enters the stage</h2>

<p>As a side note, I have to mention that part of why I dropped my initial foray into Elixir was because of a bias. I felt that it was too, Ruby-esque, whatever that must have meant to me at the time. I have somehow missed the early Ruby and Rails train around 15 years ago. My programming career set me on a different path. I have always been aware of Ruby’s community spirit, but only during the past year, did I come to appreciate the language and its writing aesthetic. Ironically, not through a Ruby itself, but via a wonderful derivative language, named <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank">Crystal</a>. I already went into more detail about Crystal <a href="https://preslav.me/2020/01/26/a-crystal-in-go-s-world/" target="_blank">in a previous post</a>.</p>

<p>The more I started dabbling into Crystal, the more I started looking at its inspiration - Ruby. Ruby is certainly not a language without flaws, and the community is trying to work on those. Partially, via addressing those issues at the core - Ruby 3.0 is expected to arrive <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/versions/5" target="_blank">at the end of this year</a>. Yet, others are taking what the language is best known for, and applying it to other paradigms - such as Elixir’s functional approach to programming.</p>

<h2 id="second-attempt-elixir-month">Second attempt: Elixir Month</h2>

<p>My second attempt to tackle Elixir seems to go much more smoothly than the first one. One day, I had the feeling that the constructs in the language just clicked for me- even the nasty OTP ones. I set out out a goal for myself to use Elixir for a month during February, and see how far I can go with it.</p>

<p>Imagine a programming language with the ergonomic syntax of Ruby, the speed of execution of C, the concurrency model of Go, and last but not least, a compiler that performs null checks at compile time. Sounds like a dream? Well, this language exists, but chances are, you haven’t heard of it so far.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank">Crystal</a>!</p>


    <img src="/images/2020/image-crystal.png"  alt="Crystal home page"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />



<p>Crystal is all of the above, plus it has types, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/overview/" target="_blank">outstanding documentation</a>, and a strong community, delivering a steady stream of new libraries (a.k.a “shards”). Don’t get fooled by the current version number (0.32.1). Crystal has been around for quite a few years (since 2012) and has a mature set of language features and an ecosystem of good libraries.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-speed-come-from">Where does the speed come from?</h2>

<p>Crystal produces fast and lightweight native applications using the LLVM infrastructure. When I say fast, I mean, <a href="https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks" target="_blank">really fast</a>. Take the fastest Go code you can find and chances are, the same code in Crystal will perform at least on par with it, and often quite a bit faster. Measuring Crystal’s performance against that of Ruby makes no sense.</p>

<p>There are no runtime frameworks or virtual machines necessary. One can just grab the compiled binary and deploy it. When compared with deploying and running a Ruby application, this feels like a whole different league.</p>

<p>Note that there are some caveats, which I am going to discuss in a future blog post. For now, let’s just say that building and distribution are equally as easy, as those in Rust. As of yet, nothing can beat the Go compiler speed-wise, but my experience with the Crystal tooling has been more than pleasant so far.</p>

<h2 id="csp-style-concurrency">CSP-style concurrency</h2>

<p>One of the things that make Go so interesting is its concurrency model. The idea about goroutines that communicate via channels is based on an approach dating back to the late 1970s, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes" target="_blank">Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)</a>. Crystal uses an analogous approach. Programs run in what is known as <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/guides/concurrency.html" target="_blank">“fibers”</a>. The main fiber can spawn any number of concurrent fibers that send and receive data via blocking channels.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-crystal" data-lang="crystal">channel <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Channel(Nil)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>new 
spawn <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>    
	puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Before send&#34;</span>    
	channel<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>send(<span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span>)    
	puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;After send&#34;</span> 
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>  

puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Before receive&#34;</span> 
channel<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>receive 
puts <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;After receive&#34;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="why-re-invent-ruby-in-2020">Why re-invent Ruby in 2020?</h2>

<p>The creators of Crystal obviously didn’t intend on changing the world of programming by creating a new language. They just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181126095302/https://manas.tech/blog/2016/04/01/the-story-behind-crystal.html" target="_blank">loved Ruby</a> and felt it sad to leave it for a more performant and type-safe alternative. Due to a series of trade-offs at the implementation level, Ruby is still slower and more memory-hungry than its competitors. Despite perfectly serving the needs of a large segment of Web users through Rails, its performance puts it at the back of the pack, when it comes to other use cases.</p>

<p>The point is fair and valid. As a language, Ruby has a concise and elegant syntax for writing. Once beyond the basic idioms, writing Ruby evokes pure joy. Crystal brings that joy to an even higher level through type-safety, native speed, and extremely simple concurrency model.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I like Go too, precisely because of its verbosity and lack of idioms. When working with others on a big project, I’d prefer more ceremony and hoops, in the name of transparency and equal code comprehension. Different languages exist to serve different purposes and be used by different groups of people. The trick is knowing when to use and when the other.</p>

<h2 id="so-is-crystal-worth-having-a-look">So, is Crystal worth having a look?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! If only to know that it exists and keep an eye on it, I’d go check it out and write a few applications with it. Whether Crystal will take off in the future is a bit more difficult to say, however. As mentioned, the 99% resemblance to Ruby is nice, and so is the blazing-fast performance. Yet, I am missing the Crystal community’s drive towards more prominence. There has been a long-awaited move towards a 1.0 release, which is a crucial milestone and would surely bring in many newcomers. To my understanding, the language and its tooling are stable enough for a 1.0 release.</p>

<p>I understand that Crystal does not have the backing of either Google or Mozilla. Neither does it have multi-billion-dollar use-cases to put on its home page. I understand that fighting for the same space with Go, C/C++, and Rust is an unfair battle. Yet, I also believe that we’re long past the days when choosing one technology over another was a zero-sum game. All it needs is a little push.</p>

<p>I am hoping for the best!</p>

            <description>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</description>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>The successful engineer realizes that the earlier he starts collaborating, the sooner others can contribute. Together they can create a culture of documentation that spreads throughout the team. Thus, every project is collaborative and has a “stone soup” feeling, as all are invited to bring their skills and insights. The more people who embody this culture, the more success it has.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>By creating a culture of continuous improvement, constantly taking baby steps along the four phases, the work becomes less stressful and easier to manage. While the other reasons listed here are quite logical, what motivates me to maintain this discipline is more emotional: I want to reduce stress and have more time for creativity and joy.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>In my little more than a year day-to-day developer experience with Go, I have so far <strong>learned three things</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can change my entire view of how programming works, even after 12+ years of doing it in one form or another.</li>
<li>People are blaming Java for all the wrong reasons</li>
<li>People are praising Go for all the wrong reasons</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me explain. This post is not about saying that “language A is better than language B”, or vice versa. It is about asking ourselves the question why things work the way they do, and whether doing them differently is a bad, or potentially, good thing.</p>

<p>Before joining the Go camp, I had worked quite a few years as a Java developer, with all the stereotypes that this role could evoke in one’s head. I co-developed data-processing systems for various industries. Yet, much of the code I wrote was just boilerplate: passing data from one format to the other, or devising complex abstractions behind what should have really just been calling a function and obtaining its result. Yes, the code was difficult to comprehend, but I was proud of it for this exact reason. The more hoops I created, the more secure I felt that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was doing what I thought was right</li>
<li>If people didn’t understand the code, they’d have to come to me for an advice, further boosting my ego.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-language-is-not-to-blame-for-this">The language is not to blame for this</h2>

<p>The fact that much of the existing Java code is full of bureaucracy has nothing to do with the language itself, or with its platform. Our developer community should bear the sole responsibility. I can assure anyone that perfectly functioning Java applications can be written without 90% of the ceremony. They will be smaller and run faster. Most probably, easier to comprehend, too. And yet, they won’t get you hired in any well-respected company. They just won’t pass the <em>developer prejudice</em> test. I know. I’ve seen many elegant solutions and rejected them for not being /idiomatic/ enough.</p>

<h2 id="go-isn-t-a-silver-bullet-either">Go isn’t a silver bullet either</h2>

<p>For much of the same reasoning, jumping ship towards Go, just because “it is not Java”, won’t bring anyone far. Even before I started writing Go, I had heard and read many stories, about how simple and fast it made everything, how little ceremony it had, compared to Java, how it would eventually kill all other languages, etc. All blah, blah. Despite all of the above being true, you have to discover the truth in each for yourselves. If you approach the language out of desperation with your current way of working, you’re going to be set for a rough path.</p>

<p>See, if you all you wanted was to get a faster running (name language of choice), you could certainly do it. Yet, holding on to the mental baggage of your previous experience will be hard and messy. My first Go project started out as a rewrite of a Spring Boot app I’d started earlier, so I thought I’d just organize it the same way. To keep the story short, let’s just say it was a spectacular disaster. Only after I started from scratch, did it really start taking off.</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-language-without-with-less-idioms">Go is a language without (with less) idioms</h2>

<p>Let’s do a naive math experiment. Imagine that you could create valid programming expressions combining any 3 keywords, from a programming language’s vocabulary. Thus, if a language only has 10 keywords, the maximum number of possible expressions is 10 * 9 * 8 = 720. In contrast, a language, with, say, 20 keywords would end up having 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840 expressions. Twice as many keywords would result in almost 10 times as many expressions!</p>

<p>Languages tend to encourage the creation and use of idioms. With that many possible expressions, it’s a normal behaviour for an individual, or a group of people to start associating and using expressions for certain things. The problems usually occur when another group comes with its own way of expressing the same thing. Both are perfectly valid, but each group would have issues understanding the other.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Go having a very strict and concise nature, is totally devoid of idioms. That would be impossible. It is in our nature to try to associate and abstract certain concepts. Yet, when a language has a deliberately smaller vocabulary, the chances for different groups accidentally finding multiple ways of doing the same thing are smaller. This helps the communication between people a great deal, but comes with a very obvious downside. Code (or any written expression, for that matter) without idioms is very, very verbose.</p>

<p>So, whoever told you that Go is not a verbose language, probably either lied to you on purpose, or had’n really seen any other programming languages up until that point. But hey, we agreed that verbosity in the name of communication and common understanding is a actually a good thing, right?s</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-test-for-senior-engineers">Go is a test for senior engineers</h2>

<p>A lot has been said about the initial concept about Go, and how the idea was to design a language for juniors fresh out of college, and with little programming experience. I think that understanding the beauty of going back to the roots of programming, can be a cathartic experience for many seasoned programmers.</p>

<p>See, junior programmers start with little baggage and preconceptions, so in their view, anything that can be done with code is fair and justified. Including, burning a CPU, or erasing a disk due to an arithmetic error.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the middle of the career path, a bunch of principles start to pile up. All of them out of the desire to step on what’s already been learned, and to make sure that things are smoothly and safely without immediate supervision. Learning and applying the principles is great, because it ensures a gradual path forward. But for many, it becomes a dogma which they blindly stick to, without asking whether a simpler alternative could be better.</p>

<p>The problem with principles is that they only work well around 80% of the time. It is the remaining 20% that can be disastrous for a project, or for one’s career. It is the understanding where to apply a principle, and where to deliberately throw it away in the name of pragmatism, which turns a software engineer into a senior software engineer.</p>

<p>To really appreciate Go, one needs to learn how to discern what makes it and its community stand out from the rest. One needs to go through a phase of utter disgust with the language, for it “lacking” certain feature. Moving on despite the urge to go back to a familiar ground, would result in one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make one realise that indeed, the Go language is not what they need or want</li>
<li>Learn to appreciate going back to the roots, as well as when to favour pragmatism over principles</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, it would be an interesting experience.</p>

            <description>I started programming Go right at the time when the topic of modularization heated up. Of course, we all know how it all played out with Go modules. They are here and they are (IMO) great. I have spent a significant amount programming Python before virtual environments were really a thing, and believe me, things got really messed up at times.
One big disadvantage of modules is that one can’t really edit them.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started programming Go right at the time when the topic of <em>modularization</em> heated up. Of course, we all know how it all played out with Go modules. They are here and they are (IMO) great. I have spent a significant amount programming Python before virtual environments were really a thing, and believe me, things got really messed up at times.</p>

<p>One big disadvantage of modules is that one can’t really edit them. For a good reason, of course. You want them to be clean and reproducible, but occasionally, one needs to just insert a <code>log.Printf</code> or a tiny inspection function somewhere. One option is to call <code>mod vendor</code>, but this would copy all the dependencies to the vendor folder. Clearly, a lot more overhead than what one would need.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://github.com/rogpeppe/gohack" target="_blank">gohack</a> comes in really handy. It uses a clever feature of the Go modules, called /replace/. It allows the user to manually override the path to a given dependency. Instead of doing all of this manually, however, gohack will do it all for you.</p>

<p>After installing go-installing gohack, go to your module-bound Go project and use it instead of <code>go get</code> for a given dependency:</p>

<pre><code>gohack get example.com/foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>gohack will fetch the code and store it in a special place inside your <code>$HOME</code> directory. It will also do the go.mod replacements for you:</p>

<pre><code>replace example.com/foo/bar =&gt; /home/me/gohack/example.com/foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>All the edits you now do to the dependency that was added to your <code>$HOME</code> folder, will now affect the project that uses it.</p>

<p>Once you have done checking, and want to revert to using the original dependency, you can simply use the undo functionality:</p>

<pre><code>gohack undo example.com/foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>or to revert all changes to all “hacked” dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>gohack undo
</code></pre>
