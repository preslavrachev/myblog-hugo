                    <p>With so many errors reported throughout the lifetime of macOS Catalina, it kind of makes sense for Apple to slow down a bit and work on polishing it. Moving towards new features without fixing the existing bugs might be disastrous for the macOS ecosystem. But again, that&rsquo;s Apple we&rsquo;re talkign about. Anything can be expected from Apple. Like, deprecating macOS altogether, and eventually, replacing it with some some sort of iOS hybrid.</p>

 The President Is Trapped  Trump is utterly unsuited to deal with this crisis, either intellectually or temperamentally. https://www.theatlantic.com |  Created with Linqable     The president will try to blame someone else—but in this case the “someone else” is a virus, not a Mexican immigrant or a reporter with a disability, not a Muslim or a Clinton, not a dead war hero or a family of a fallen soldier, not a special counsel or an NFL player who kneels for the national anthem.</p>

                    <p>This post is a sort of a time capsule. An attempt to journal my thoughts at this particular point in time. Despite the seemingly rough first part, I want it to have a hopeful message. I think that now is the time to re-align our principles, and set new trajectories.
Everywhere around the world, things are still developing faster than anyone had expected. More and more people getting infected, sick, and some, eventually dying.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR: This is not a drill! Despite the seemingly low moratilty rate in Germany, nearly 3000 people might die by the end of April alone. We can help keep many of them alive.
Judging by how much people in Munich seem to enjoy the sunny days of spring, I am going to conclude that either:
 they all live in complete denial of the situation they already gave up they fully trust that no matter what happens, the German healthcare system would fix them in no time.</p>

Least of all, for the ones fighting for their lives, and those, doing their best to bring things back to normal. It needs patience and coordinated effort, but we&rsquo;ll make it through, sooner or later. Patience and perseverance are hard, I know, but those are what has kept humanity moving forward.

                    <p>My foray into Elixir brought forward many more similarities between it and Go, than I originally expected. One of them is how both handle concurrency. With respect to that, creating Elixir-style stateful actors in Go is surprisingly easy. Answering the question, whether one needs them, or can make use of them, I’d leave to the user. If you approach me back saying that the same thing can be achieved using a channel or a map with sync.</p>

                    <p>iEx (Elixir&rsquo;s interactive shell) is pure dope! It helped bring my development efforts back to the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s play and see what happens&rdquo; level. Since Elixir modules are stateless and made up of pure functions, reloading a module is as easy as calling r MyModule inside iEx. During development, I&rsquo;d try to keep one module called Demo, or Scratch, etc, where I&rsquo;d do the quick and dirty setting up of things. This scratch module would usually have one function only, called demo or run.</p>

                    <p>Yes, the Elixir. I’ve decided to use the cold February weather, as well as the relative project calm, and see how far I can go with it.
But why Elixir and why just now? There are a few reasons. Actually, this is not my first encounter with the language or the Erlang/BEAM ecosystem. About a year ago, a colleague at work and I started doing lunch break walks, in which we discussed tech topics, beyond the scope of our current projects.</p>

Sounds like a dream? Well, this language exists, but chances are, you haven’t heard of it so far.

                    <p>Here are a few lines from Manual Work is a Bug that I firmly stand by:
 The successful engineer has a quick way to create documents for new procedures and to find existing procedures. People with this mindset avoid the cognitive load of deciding whether or not a task is worth documenting, because they document everything. On finding a potential improvement, they are not slowed by the speed bump of switching from a document viewer to a document editor because they work from the editor at the start.</p>

 I can change my entire view of how programming works, even after 12+ years of doing it in one form or another.

                    <p>I started programming Go right at the time when the topic of modularization heated up. Of course, we all know how it all played out with Go modules. They are here and they are (IMO) great. I have spent a significant amount programming Python before virtual environments were really a thing, and believe me, things got really messed up at times.
One big disadvantage of modules is that one can’t really edit them.</p>

There is no doubt that Vienna is a world city, both historically, geographically, and culturally. For years in a row, the city has been named the world’s best place to live in, and as much as Munich is trying to steal the title, it’s not come close yet.</p>

                    <p>Buying the wrong product happens all the time, and apps make no exception to that. Although it does not apply to every country, if you live within the EU, you have the right to ask for a full refund of your purchases, no strings attached. You can do that with apps you have bought from the App Store too, without having to provide an explanation. It is actually very easy, though providers try to put a few stones on the way.</p>

This is perhaps an unpopular opinion, but for whatever it is worth, I am going to let my mind speak. I would like to emphasize on the fact that I am, and will always be a Bulgarian, despite my conscious choice to live and have business somewhere else.
The reason why Bulgaria is so poor has nothing to do with its nature and geographic location.</p>

                    <p>In the Go community, there is some kind of paranoia around panicking, as if it’s the worst thing that can happen to your application. In fact, it often is the better option. Think about Go programs as CLI applications. Would you rather crash right away and let the user react, or hang, trying to recover? The same applies to applications running as services. Modern tooling makes it easy to automatically restart a crashing service within seconds.</p>

                    <p>With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I’ve been following over the years.
From people to topics Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter.</p>

                    <p>Note: Unlike my usual posts, this is a very basic, non-technical explanation. A friend asked me this question, and I thought I might share the answer here. You can use it on your next cocktail party 🍻
It mainly boils down to how memory garbage gets collected on each platform. iOS applications rely on an approach called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Every piece of memory that gets assigned some value gets tracked and released, as soon as the number of its accessors reaches zero.</p>

                    <p>The other day, I had to go over some (not so) old Python code I wrote. The moment I started pulling my hair, came not when I figured out that I could no longer understand what it does. It was when I looked at how the code was formatted. To be precise - at its total lack of any formatting.

                    <p>Have you heard about the Pareto Principle? Also known as the 80&frasl;20 Rule, it states that for many aspects of life, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the inputs. Flip it around and the opposite is also true: reaching out for the rest of the 20% requires 80% of the initial effort. It is amazing how many manifestations of both exist in real life. One of the big wisdoms in life - it is often not the smartest, fastest, or strongest individuals that leave a dent.</p>

                    <p>This morning, a humble distance runner from Kenya once again proved that the impossible is only a state of mind. A performance, more resembling a concert symphony than an endurance race. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour marathon barrier today - something that for years was deemed unthinkable for any human being:
  This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge&rsquo;s achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.</p>

                    <p>Give me more like these&hellip; Search engines are a great tool for content discovery beyond the simple text searching. Often, it is difficult to express exactly what we are looking for. This may be due to limitations of the interface, or our own struggle to explain it in enough detail. There is one thing, however, which we are fairly good at. Given two things, we can easily say which one we like more than the other.</p>

l := content.NewLoader() l.PageCount = 5 c := l.Load(bytes)  Can you be sure that what you are loading is actually going to contain five pages? What if another goroutine having access to l, interjects and sets PageCount to 1000? Or worse, updates the state of l such that a panic is inevitable?</p>

                    <p>You have seen them many times. Small snippets of code and the question &ldquo;What would the the following piece of code print&rdquo; beneath. You might have tried taking a guess, and perhaps, even failed.

                    <p>NOTE: This is not a paid product endorsement. I&rsquo;m just a happy customer. I have recently bought a full license of GoLand for a year. The trial served me well for a few months, but the IDE shutting down automatically after every 30 minutes of work, became way too annoying. I know, I shouldn&rsquo;t rely on an IDE for writing Go, when VS Code or Vim would have worked just fine.</p>

                    <p>Many thanks to @themaour for sharing this tip on Twitter TIL that in Go, struct size depends on how underlying types were defined.
struct { a bool b int32 c string d string }  The size of the struct above is is different from the one down below
struct { b int32 c string d string a bool }  Why is that? Well, think of memory as consisting of segments of certain size, where, if the amount of data you fill the segment with is bigger than the current remainder of the segment, the data will get written onto the next segment.</p>

 We have all heard that story, but how many of us can admit that we play the frog on a daily basis? Especially at work, people tend to put a lot more focus on what they are working on and rather, avoid having a say on how the rest of the organization moves forward.</p>

                    <p>I have recently made my project Mixtape open to the world. Mixtape is a search and discovery platform for podcasts, built exclusively using Go. I decided to use Go primarily because of its compiler&rsquo;s ability to deliver small, self-contained executables with close-to-metal native performance and extremely low memory footprint. It was also a way to battle-test the stack and figure out where and how it will benefit future projects in my portfolio.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s probably not too important, in the grand scheme of things, whether you are using a language like Erlang or not. While I do feel it&rsquo;s under-used and under-rated, the biggest benefit of it is not in running a system that uses it. The biggest benefit comes from learning about the fundamentals of solid system design, and internalizing its lessons in a practical context.
  Ten Years of Erlang  For my ten years in the Erlang community, I decided to cover a few topics such as hype phases and how this related to Erlang, the ladder of ideas within the language and how that can impact adoption, what changed in my decade there, and what I think Erlang still has to bring to the programming community at large.</p>

                    <p>One of the things that I find really neat about Go, is the single-executable delivery model. For small projects, it&rsquo;s as simple as dragging and dropping the built executable right where I need it. After some time, however, I might easily forget which version of my codebase a given executable has been built upon. If I have to revert a change, how can I make sure that I build from the right commit?</p>

                    <p>Go is definitely not the first language on my mind, when I hear the term “Functional Programming”. Yet, functions are first-class citizens in Go, and one can achieve a lot using higher-order functions (those that can receive and/or return other functions) alone.
In this post, I want to demonstrate the use of functional constructs for implementing the well-known Builder pattern. Please, note that there are many ways to implement a Builder, and I don&rsquo;t claim that mine is certainly the best.</p>

 Don’t question whether something is advanced enough to share it. Don’t worry if that knowledge already exists on the internet. The only question you need to ask yourself is this:
What do I know?

                    <p>One of the things I often hear from other developers, along with the usual “Python is slow”, is that “multithreading in Python sucks”. The sad reality is that I hear those from Python developers too. While I will pretend I have not heard the former accusation (hoping you’ve already heard how well Python integrates with C), I will try to bring up some light on the latter.
When I ask the same guys about why they think that multithreading in Python sucks, some of them mention the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) as the root cause.</p>

                    <p>Today, I took part in the Sixtus Half-Marathon near lake Schliersee for the third time in a row. Unlike last year, this time I started with a completely different strategy - keep it cool and let everyone else pass by me during the first third of the race. Seeing everyone else&rsquo;s backs can be demotivating and requires a lot of patience and training.
   After the first 5-6K, having realized that I was really the last of the HM group, I started slowly picking up the pace.</p>

Yet, I somehow felt the need to write down the reasons why I am giving Go a second (or maybe, third 🤔) chance. To the Java developers out there, searching for a new weapon of choice, I am hoping that this will give you a bit of perspective. This is not a description of Go-specific features.</p>

As developers, we spend a large portion of our time, searching for the &ldquo;name of the function abc that did thing xyz&rdquo;. Not surprisingly, sites like StackOverflow have become so popular. Yet, SO answers are often full of additional information, and what we need most of the time is a simple search on top of the docs themselves. Years ago, I used a tool for macOS, called Dash.</p>

                    <p>Docker containers have proven themselves extremely useful in allowing developers to sandbox environments and ease the deployment of services. Have a complicated service setup? No worries. Simply, describe the steps in a Dockerfile and you should be able to replicate the process on every host OS that has Docker support.
When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services.</p>

                    <p>With a few short micro-post exceptions, my blog has been relatively quiet over the past month. The reason for this is simple. I have devoted much of my writing resources of the past weeks into a new site. A wiki called DevNotes.
That is right, I have started a separate writing project, parallel to my blog. Yet, before you start thinking that this is the end of the blog, don't worry.</p>

                    <p>Last week, I made my first tentative foray into Go programming. My company uses Go in a couple of projects, but although I have heard many positive things about the language, so far I have tried to stay away from it. The mere thought that Go is a 21st Century version of C and has been explicitly designed from the start to not try to be much more than that, can make everyone coming from Kotlin and Swift pull a few hairs at first.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago, I was invited to give a talk at the Munich Kotlin Users Group meetup (check out my slides here) For quite some time, I have had an idea to promote Kotlin as the missing link between software engineering and Data Science. DuringKotlinConf 2018, I had the chance and the privilege to meet a couple of amazing people, whose talks only helped confirm my thoughts.

                    <p>Hard-coding configuration is bad. This is one of the things that newbie programmers learn quickly after they realize that have committed sensitive information to a public GitHub repository. And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing.</p>

In 2018, I:
 Got engaged Changed my job Started new new side projects Attended 4 conferences and countless meetups Had my own chance to present in front of an audience (twice) Visited 5 countries and met many new people Read 15 books Wrote nearly 30 blog posts Ran 626 km, and finished 4 half-marathons Made between 5,500 and 6,000 push-ups  Wow, quite a year, heh?</p>

                    <p>Often, the seemingly simple things can make you spend hours chasing around your tail. Like trying to connect to a MongoDB instance using KMongo.
Basically, if you have checked out the KMongo quick start, setting up a client and fetching some data should be extremely easy:
val client = KMongo.createClient() //get com.mongodb.MongoClient new instance val database = client.getDatabase(&quot;test&quot;) //normal java driver usage val col = database.getCollection&lt;Jedi&gt;() //KMongo extension method  The quick start tutorial assumes that your DB resides on mongodb://localhost:27017, but in reality, your MongoDB connection string looks more like this:</p>

                    <p>This is the first part of a two-part series. In this post, I will introduce Flask-RestPlus and demonstrate how to start organising APIs around its simple REST-based conventions. Next time, I will address the topic of request/response marshalling (serialisation) and validation.
A seasoned Spring developer, I felt a bit uneasy when designing and future-proofing a Flask-based API for the first time. I have recently started using Python way beyond my original intention to just play with data, and found Flask to be a super-easy micro-service alternative to Spring Boot or Ktor.</p>

 Opinion | The Dying Art of Disagreement  Today’s clashes may hoarsen our voices, but they rarely sharpen our thinking, much less change our minds. https://www.nytimes.com |  Created with Linqable     Intelligent disagreement is the lifeblood of any thriving society. Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person — or even allowing someone else to listen.</p>

                    <p>So, you might have heard about Mastodon. A micro-blogging alternative to Twitter, boasting itself for being 100% open-source, and for its decentralised nature.
  Unlike traditional social networks like Twitter and Facebook, Mastodon is not driven by a single company profiting by selling your identity to others, but by a network of instance maintainers and supporters who put their own money on the line. Ensuring that Mastodon is going to live in the long term sounds easy&hellip;on paper.</p>

                    <p>This article is a follow-up transcription to a talk I recently gave at a local Munich machine learning meetup. Unlike my previous talk, this time I wanted to convey the idea of using an iPad for actively running data science experiments, as opposed to passively consuming information. I illustrated my point with a few example iOS applications I personally use on a daily basis, which I hope would be good starting points to get the audience interested in the idea.</p>

                    <p>Often, I would work on a Python module and add changes to it live, which I would then want to test immediately. Piece of cake! Add the changes and execute the script again. Well, that’s certainly a way, but as modules get bigger, they tend to import other modules, or do some preliminary setup work.
With time, I have developed this practice of opening up a Python REPL (though I recommend IPython or the Jupyter Console for that), importing my in-progress module and singling out separate functions I would like to test.</p>

                    <p>Twitter can be a mess sometimes. If you follow tons of people, it’s easy to get lost in the torrent of constant updates. This was one of the reasons why Twitter decided to move away from the purely chronological timeline a couple of years ago. In a move that almost ditched the diehard Twitter fans in favor of the mainstream, predominantly passive content consumers, the company started pushing more and more in favour of algorithmically adjusted timelines, much like Facebook does it.</p>

This time, you got much higher - say 95% questions answered correctly. You repeat the same procedure again and again, and on the 4th attempt, you score the maximum 100%.</p>

 A synapse—the connection between two neurons—consumes at most 100 femtoJoules per event. Once you realize that the entire human body is about the equivalent of an 120W light bulb, you can see that the efficiency of the brain is just astounding. [&hellip;] This result has implications.

chrome --disable-web-security  then, as usually, start remote debugging from your app, and open: http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui on your computer.</p>

                    <p>Securing your ElasticSearch instances and keeping all the fun Often, we choose convenience over security. Many modern tools such as MongoDB and ElasticSearch, have grown in popularity, partly because of their easy-to-set-up-and-tinker-with nature. Just spin off an instance, point your browser to the right URL and you&rsquo;re ready to start sending queries.
Unfortunately, one thing comes for another, and as we have recently seen, ElasticSearch left in the open can be a vulnerable target, same as MongoDB was in its heyday.</p>

                    <p>Without any doubt, Java is a verbose language. This verbosity of the language makes it easy to understand Java code by new programmers. It is though one of the reasons, why many Java programmers find writing Java code tedious. Kotlin brings a touch of succinctness in places, where even programmers new to Java, may find code unnecessarily over-bloated.
How many times have you had to do the same thing over and over again:</p>

                    <p>It is part of common sense to assume that the worthiest commit messages lie far from any extremes. Years ago, I often fell in the trap of hastily sending a commit after commit, annoyed by the fact that I have to add a summary to it (let alone a description). I&rsquo;ve seen many projects whose commit summaries consist primarily of one-word verbs like [FIX], [CLEAN], [TEST], etc.
They don&rsquo;t tell much do they?</p>

                    <p>So you&rsquo;ve been trying to wrap your heads around and decide between Grunt and Gulp? Yeah, me too, been there, done that. In my case, the decision wasn&rsquo;t really hard. I&rsquo;ve never had strong feelings for Grunt, and for a long time, I used a custom made ANT script. I used to copy it over to every new project, and it helped me with basic tasks — moving, copying, cleaning, linting, minifying, etc.</p>
