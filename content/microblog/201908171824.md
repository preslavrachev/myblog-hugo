All of my Vue.js apps are being developed by proxying API calls to a remote server. This is why one of the first things I do with a new Vue.js app is to st up a `vue.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      "/": {
        target: "https://remote-server.com",
        changeOrigin: true
      }
    }
  }
};
```

When calling `yarn serve`, I get the following message flashing in the developer console:

```
The connection to ws://remote-server.com was interrupted while the page was loading.
```

The app seems running and proxying to the remote API works just fine, but this annoying message obliterates everything else in the developer console. Thankfully, there is an easy way to get rid of it. Simply, add a `ws: false` to the configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      "/": {
        target: "https://remote-server.com",
        changeOrigin: true,
        ws: false
      }
    }
  }
};
```
