The short pause from running is over and I am back to action. First things first, I bought a new pair of running shoes:

Those are called [Adidas Terrex Two Boa](https://amzn.to/2XwXRm2). They feature a very stiff, but sturdy underfoot part (because they are made for trail running), and an innovative lacing system called [Boa](https://www.boafit.com/en-us). It was a bit of a love at first sight, but I amnot really sure, if I am going to get used to those shoes. In particular, the lacing system seems fancy, but once it gets damaged, do I have to throw the shoes away? Who knows.
