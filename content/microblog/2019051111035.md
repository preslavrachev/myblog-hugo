This is one of the best movies about running I have seen in a while. Although I peaked at the half-marathon distance (21K), I do run for pretty much the reasons that motivate this guy to run 100 miles. I also fight the same daemons along the race, urging me to stop and quit all the time.

One thing I learned during the 3 years of active running: 

> Distance running is 20% physical and 80% mental fitness.
