One of the best podcasts interviews I have listened to in the past couple of months, if not during the past year. Guy Raz sits down together with [Tobias LÃ¼tke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_L%C3%BCtke), co-founder and CEO of [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). You might not have heard of Shopify, but surely, if you have bought anything online during the past few years, which did not come form Amazon, you most certainly have used its flagship product.

Out of his passion for snowboarding, Tobias has managed to build a market leader in online sales software. Yet, I was amazed at how humble his whole attitude is. This is one trait I can directly trace to his German roots.

Fun fact: Tobias was one of the early adopters of Ruby on Rails, and as a result, Shopify is one of the largest sites using it nowadays, and a major flagship showcase, together with [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/).

Listen to the whole show:
