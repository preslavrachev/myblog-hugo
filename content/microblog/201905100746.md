Google will [soon introduce searching for podcast episodes](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/google-search-will-offer-better-news-coverage-and-soon-support-for-podcast-search/) as part of its search results. This much was said during the keynote of this year's [Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io/). At first, I thought that this might put down my efforts to build a podcast search engine myself, but then i thought it through. The fact that Google recognizes the importance of podcasts is not only not a motivation killer, but also a serious reassurance about their importance.
