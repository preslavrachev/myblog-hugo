Some interesting observations on the Eurovision Song Contest winners since the year 2000. Not surprisingly, the majority of the winners are in a minor key. Like, this yearsâ€™ winner from The Netherlands (A minor).

Songs written in a major key seem to be showing a directly oppising trend, often hotting the hard rock bottom.
