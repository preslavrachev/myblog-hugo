> _“Once a language gets complex enough, programming in it is more like carving out a subset from an infinite sea of features, most of which we’ll never learn. Once a language feels infinite, the costs of adding further features to it are no longer apparent”. -_ [_Mark Miller_](https://medium.com/@erights/the-tragedy-of-the-common-lisp-why-large-languages-explode-4e83096239b9)

I plead to the Go team to re-evaluate the data sets being used before the `try` error handling experiment finds itself in any version of the language.
