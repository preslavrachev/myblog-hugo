> Despite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent [survey of Canadian adults](https://medium.com/@CanadianPodcastListener/if-i-watch-listen-to-it-on-youtube-is-it-still-a-podcast-22e64a0129ab) found that 43 percent of people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.” That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).

> Some of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein’s [H3 Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtREJY21xRfCuEKvdki1Kw) or [Joe Rogan’s Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ), have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch. While the podcasts are also distributed via Spotify and Apple Podcasts, YouTube acts as a first stop.
