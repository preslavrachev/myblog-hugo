It has been almost a decade, since I last set foot in the city center of Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia. Although I fly home regularly, Sofia’s Airport is just an intermediary stop on my ultimate route to my hometown.

This time was different. My wife and I flew for the wedding of one of our best friends, and since we had a whole day to spare, we decided to take a walk through the centre of the _City of Trams_.

For those who have never been in Sofia, trams are a major form of transportation here, the first line having been established back in 1901. Although Sofia citizens enjoy a modern (and surprisingly clean) subway, trams have long been one of the things that people usually associate the city's center with.
