One handy developer tool tip for today: [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)

As developers, we spend a large portion of our time, searching for the _"name of the function abc that did thing xyz"_. Not surprisingly, sites like StackOverflow have become so popular, but SO answers are often full of additional information, where what we need most of the time is a simple search on top of  the docs themselves. Years ago, I used a tool for macOS, called [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash).
