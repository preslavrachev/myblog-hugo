One handy developer tool tip for today: [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)

As developers, we spend a large portion of our time, searching for the _"name of the function abc that did thing xyz"_. Not surprisingly, sites like StackOverflow have become so popular, but SO answers are often full of additional information, where what we need most of the time is a simple search on top of  the docs themselves. Years ago, I used a tool for macOS, called [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash). It was a good tool at the time, but eventually, I stopped using it, because it was accessing my (still spinning) HDD way too much at the time.

A couple of years ago, I discovered [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/). It is the same idea, but running on the Web (supports offline as well) and accessible from everywhere. It has been my primary go-to docs site for much of my non-library-specific stuff (programming language syntax, standard libraries, popular frameworks). The default selection of docsets is pretty satisfactory and there are many coming all the time.
