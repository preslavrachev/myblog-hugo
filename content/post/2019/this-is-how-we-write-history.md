This morning, a humble distance runner from Kenya once again proved that the impossible is only a state of mind. A performance, more resembling a concert symphony than an endurance race. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour marathon barrier today - something that for years was deemed unthinkable for any human being:

This is the beginning of a new era of running. I am certain that Kipchoge's achievement will inspire others, if not to try a and beat it, to at least get out and be active.

No human is limited!

To the critics: Yes, it was not an official race, yes, Kipchoge did wear special cushioned shoes, and drank electrolyte gels. Yes, it was an incredibly well engineering feat. One, where everyone, from the shoe designer and the single factory worker, through the pacers, crewmen, and spectators, to Kipchoge himself, played an equally important part. 

And so it should be. As a species, we have been destined to move forward and achieve great things only when doing things together. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, this victory comes right time, when we badly need the good example of a group of individuals achieving the impossible by going beyond the limitations of body, mind, and spirit.
