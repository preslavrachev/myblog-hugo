With so much going on Twitter, we long have passed the point of being able to just look at our timelines and stay up-to-date. In fact, I have personally stopped following and would even go as far as to remove a significant portion of the people I’ve been following over the years.

# From people to topics

Before anyone gets offended by my supposed rudeness, let me clear up. I do get to stay up-to-date with a large variety of stuff on Twitter. I achieve this with by organizing accounts into thematic lists, combined with clever searching.

If you have never created a single list on Twitter, you’re missing half the fun. At the moment of this writing, I actively curate [around 50 lists](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists). The majority of those revolve around a certain topic I’m interested about, say [Go](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/go-developers) or [Python](https://twitter.com/preslavrachev/lists/python-developers) programming. Others are location based (Bremen, Munich, Bulgaria). In short, the fact that I don’t follow people on Twitter into a single timeline does not mean that that I don’t follow them at all. It’s actually the opposite - I follow many more people into many more thematically organized timelines.

This won’t solve the original problem, will it? In fact, many timelines must be making it a hell of a time to stay on top of each one. Well, yes, and this is where the power of clever searching comes to the stage.

In a [previous article](https://preslav.me/2018/04/02/how-to-use-twitter-more-efficiently-with-these-hidden-search-features/), I wrote at length about some of the hidden powers of Twitter searching. One of the many examples I presented in my article was using a Twitter list as the base filter for your search. Put simply, the following search:

```
list:username/list “climate change”
```

Will only return results that match the query `climate change`, but only within the scope of the given list. Search for the right topics within the right lists, and you automatically get a significant noise reduction. As lists will inevitably get bigger, you can further reduce the noise, by leaving out only tweets with certain popularity or number of responses to.

```
list:username/list “climate change” min_retweets:3
```

or

```
list:username/list “climate change” min_replies:3
```

I have saved many such searches, which I then keep open on my favourite Twitter client. I like using [TweetBot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) for iOS and macOS, but one could easily [TweetDeck’s](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) tabs for the same purpose.

P.S. I hear that Twitter is also going to release some support for topic subscriptions as soon as this week. Let’s wait and see the final outcome. Until then, I keep using the method, I described above.
