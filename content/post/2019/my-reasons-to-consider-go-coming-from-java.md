I hate listicles, and I am highly hoping that this doesn‚Äôt become one of them. Yet, I somehow felt the need to write down the reasons why I am giving Go a second (or maybe, third ü§î) chance. To the Java developers out there, searching for a new weapon of choice, I am hoping that this will give you a bit of perspective. This is not a description of Go-specific features. For those, readers can find plenty of information online.

# Go focuses on ‚Äúless is more"

The first time I saw a relatively simple Go program, my internal reaction was ‚ÄúWhy all the torture?‚Äù. Somehow, things I used to solve with a Python or even a Java one-liner, look ginormously over-bloated in Go. At least, on the surface. Searching for an answer, I found this talk by Rob Pike, which helped put things in some order:

The thing is, unlike other languages, Go has been left out of many ‚Äúniceties‚Äù of modern programming, and this was an intentional decision. More features add a level of cognitive burden. Of course, they also add more productivity, but at the cost of a higher comprehension barrier. I remember the days before Java 8, and how excited I was to see lambdas and streams make it into the language. A lot of previously lengthy boilerplate code was about to get replaced by a more elegant and fluent approach. Suddenly, every problem I ran into, I tried to solve using those two alone. So much so, that I often ended up spending hours screwing the logic of my code, because suddenly, no other approach seemed elegant enough. And I was not alone in this - the rest of my team was doing it too. Not long after, some pieces of the code turned into crystal figures - beautiful at first sight, but very brittle and difficult to move around.
