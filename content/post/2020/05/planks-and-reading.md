You all have seen it at least once. The stupid tele commercial promising a ripped six pack, while watching TV, or reading a book on the couch. I'II be honest with you. I can't promise you any of that. Yet, in a way, if you follow my advice, you can develop a routine that can strengthen your body and mind. Especially now, when moving outside is difficult.

Planks are a simple, but an incredibly effective exercise. Get on all fours, as if for doing a push up, but rather, use your forearms, instead of your hands. Got it? Now, don't move and simply lock your body in this position for as long as you can.

That's really it! If you were expecting a page-long explanation of how to do a plank, I am sorry to disappoint you. keeping your posture straight (like the lady on the photo above) is the most important bit. This part cannot-be explained in any other way than going for a single short plank. You may pause your reading, try a simple plane, and stop at the slightest sign of pressure. Even if thot's just a few seconds, do n't worry too much about it. You' Il be able to ramp it up as days move on. You don't want to get injured right at the start.

I started doing planes back in December last year. It was more or less out of necessity. Due to an issue with my wrist, I had to cut my push-up routine. I had heard about planes before, but never taken them seriously. Staying locked in one place for minutes without moving seemed pointless. Yet, I had no choice. I needed some sort of an alternative to push-ups, and being able to use my forearms instead was crucial. I am so grateful I did. I learned two very important things:

1. Sustaining a plank is much harder than
it looks. The first time I tried, I crashed on the floor apter merely 40s. I decided to not discourage myself after the first attempt, but give myself a long-term goal-say, lock my body for 10 minutes. Like training for a marathon, I wouldn't go for the 42 km. directly, but use my first attempt as a base and gradually increase until I reach my milestone. I have been doing planks almost every day since, increasing my time with 5s on every next attempt, until I reached 5 minutes without a break. I have been plateauing consistently between 5 and 6 mins for the past month, preparing my mind and body for conquering the 10- minute mark.

the second thing came, once I were able to lock my body in a plank position for more than two minutes regularly. The obvious effects on my upper and lower back, glutes, and abs were hard to ignore. I've been practicing distance running non-stop since 2016, but only after a few 2-min morning planks, did I notice the positive change in my running stride. I felt, as if the pressure that usually hit straight in my knees, now spread across a whole new group of muscles, which had largely been un- utilized until then.

What's more though, similar to a distance run, sustaining a plane for a long time is just as much an exercise for the body, as it is por the mind. Success in each is largely a result of either getting your mind distracted from the task at hand, or learn how to quiet it down. Taming the mind is extremely difficult, and I am still in my early days of learning how to do it.. Keeping the mind distracted, howeveris not that hard. I found Hist the best way to not think about the pain and pressure during a plane was reading a book. Fixating my mind on the pages, I would often not notice how a few minutes have passed. What's even cooler, since humans are essentially a slightly more advanced version of Pavlov's dog, one can associate and habitual ire one behavior with the drive for another. Thus, the drive to read a few more pages will push you to sustain the plank a little longer. The opposite is also true. The strive to get better at the exercise would crave some more distraction and focusing the mind somewhere else, e.g at a few more pages.

try it and you won't be sorry.
