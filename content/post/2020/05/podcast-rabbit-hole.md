["Rabbit Hole"](https://art19.com/shows/rabbit-hole) is a podcast series about the adverse effects of online media and technology. Those are hard to notice at first. Yet, algorithms dictate much of what we watch, listen or read about nowadays. Algorithms, designed with a single goal in mind- to maximize engagement. Algorithms, which, whether intentionally or unintentionally, create echo chambers around hot topics, evoking deeply hidden desires and radical thoughts.

I can totally recommend this podcast. I will just say, though. Always take everything you're presented, with a grain of salt. Including "Rabbit Hole", or my blog for that matter.
