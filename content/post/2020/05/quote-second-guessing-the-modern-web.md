This is a quote from [Second-guessing the modern web](https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html) by [Tom MacWright](https://twitter.com/tmcw):

> [But] I’m at the point where you look at where the field is and what the alternatives are – taking a second look at unloved, unpopular, uncool things like Django, Rails, Laravel – and think what the heck is happening. We’re layering optimizations upon optimizations in order to get the SPA-like pattern to fit every use case, and I’m not sure that it is, well, worth it.

Tom continues:

> Frameworks should lure people into the pit of success, where following the normal rules and using normal techniques is the winning approach.
> 
> I don’t think that React, in this context, really is that pit of success. A naïvely implemented React SPA isn’t stable, or efficient, and it doesn’t naturally scale to significant complexity
