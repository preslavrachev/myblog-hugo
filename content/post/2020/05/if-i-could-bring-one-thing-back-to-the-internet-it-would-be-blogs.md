This is a great quote from ["If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs"]()

I first saw the word "blog" in a magazine article back in 2003.

It was right at the time when Google bought Blogger and made it a world phenomenon. I remember my first blog, the first time someone visited it, left a comment, linked back. It was a different time back then. Much more ad-hoc, there was a lot more serendipity, and a lot of random encounters. People wrote mainly for themselves, not even hoping that someone else would get to see their writing, let alone, make a fortune with it. This gave them the freedom to write about they want, not just on the topics that would trigger them the most clicks.

Yes, I know what you are going to say, many do that today still, don't they? It's not the same. It's just not the same.
