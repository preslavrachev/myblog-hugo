Here is a great [essay by The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/), which is just as relevant today, as it was 5 years ago (at the time of its writing):

> Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.

then it goes on

> Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of “engineer.” An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity.

Here are my 2 cents on the whole thing. Having seen one or two cycles in the software industry, I cannot help but agree wholeheartedly. As much as it hurts to say it, we, the IT folks are engineers as much as kids on the beach building a sand castle are engineers. Being an engineer is more than just being able to build something. It is an obligation to sustain. To build things that withstand the test of time. Not just hop from one cool piece of tech to the next, leaving vapour behind. It's hard, I am guilty of this too. But we can all accept it, and strive to become real engineers.
