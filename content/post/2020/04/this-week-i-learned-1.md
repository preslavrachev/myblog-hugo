## Apps and Tools

### AutoSleep

In my opinion, [AutoSleep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111) is the best sleep tracker for iOS right now. The level of detail and accuracy is just scary. Best of all, unlike other sleep tracking apps, AutoSleep continuously checks for sleep patterns throughout the day, so you won't miss the accidental afternoon nap. All that in a very batter-efficient manner.

Although having an Apple Watch is recommended, its use during the night is not required. If you take the watch off before you go to sleep, AutoSleep will count that as the approximate time you go to bed, until the moment you put the watch on your hand again.

### Flow

For those that like the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), or want to try it out, the [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) time tracker will be an ideal macOS companion.
