I am a child of the 90s. Technically, I was born in 1987, but I spent much of my childhood and early teenage years during the 90s. As every kid of that era, I was mesmerized by early-age 3D games. During my growing up, there was no better example of what the digital future held for us, than Sony's PlayStation. As a kid, I only wanted to play great games, and console makers seemed like the good guys making sure we get to play them. I never even realized how rivalry, fierce competition, and trickery tactics there were between Sony, Nintendo, and SEGA at the time. This mini podcast series pulls the curtain of the story behind the stage.
