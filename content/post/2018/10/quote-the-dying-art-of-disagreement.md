Here is a quote from:

{{<oembed "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/opinion/dying-art-of-disagreement.html">}}

> Intelligent disagreement is the lifeblood of any thriving society. Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person â€” or even allowing someone else to listen. The results are evident in the parlous state of our universities, and the frayed edges of our democracies.
