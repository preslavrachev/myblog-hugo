> A synapse—the connection between two neurons—consumes at most 100 femtoJoules per event. Once you realize that the entire human body is about the equivalent of an 120W light bulb, you can see that the efficiency of the brain is just astounding. [...]
> This result has implications. If this research does turn out to be the way forward, neural networks will not operate faster than our own brains. And it will take a lot of development before artificial neural networks are as interconnected as the neurons of our own brains. If neural networks are going to show an advantage, it has to come from other directions.
