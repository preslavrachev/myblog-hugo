## Work

I am currently working as a senior engineer and project technical lead at [KI labs GmbH](https://www.ki-labs.com/).

Before that, I spent years builiding systems for the [real-estate financing sector](https://www.check24.de/baufinanzierung/), as well as [ones](https://tellitapp.com/) aggregating large amounts of data from various sources.

## Personal Projects

Besides my work obligations, I have set time aside for personal endeavours.

### NoEmbed

[NoEmbed](https://noembed.preslav.me/) is an easy way to create engaging URL previews from every link - even when the underlying site does not provide the necessary metadata. NoEmbed strives to be smart, fast, and WYSIWYG - there are no hidden ads, or suspicious analytics on behalf of end users. API consumers get only what they paid for - engaging URL previews.
