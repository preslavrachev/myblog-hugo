## Mixtape

[Mixtape](https://mixtape.preslav.me/) is a search engine for podcast content. It stands out from the rest, because of its _focus on episodes, rather than entire feeds_. Just like mixtapes in the old days, it allows listeners to search and subscribe to topics of interests, rather than to separate feeds. It also allows audio enthusiasts to pick and share particular audio clips with friends. Something like this:

## NoEmbed

[NoEmbed](https://noembed.preslav.me/) is an easy way to create engaging URL previews from every link - even when the underlying site does not provide the necessary metadata. NoEmbed strives to be smart, fast, and WYSIWYG - there are no hidden ads, or suspicious analytics on behalf of end users. API consumers get only what they paid for - engaging URL previews.
