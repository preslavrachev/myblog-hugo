# Scooter Craze

The scooter invasion reached Germany as well. ðŸ˜² If I recall correctly, electric scooter renting has been a hot topic across German courts, and has only been officially given a legal status at the beginning of July.

In what seems only a couple of days, hundreds of these have been dropped on the streets of Munich. Now both locals and tourists, thirsty for some thrill from their boring day, are desperately trying to end the lives of innocent pedestrians. I just hope they don't follow the fate of [OBike's rentable bikes](https://www.instagram.com/obikesofmunich/), some of which ended up in the local river. An electric scooter's battery is a mini lab of toxic stuff, so if this is in your mind, please, think twice.
