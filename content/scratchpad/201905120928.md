# Back to Wunderlist

After what seems like an eternity (close to 3 years), I decided to install and try [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) again. For those who have followed the story, Microsoft bought Wunderlist in 2015 for an undisclosed, but very high amount of money (in the 100s of millions of dollars). The intention was to create what came out to be [Microsoft To-Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/en-us) - a half-baked (IMHO) product that not only did not stick with me, but pushed me away from using a ToDo app whatsoever.

Three years later, Wunderlist still seems alive and kicking. Despite claims that it will eventually be replaced by Microsoft To-Do there are no signs of this happening (yet). In fact, there might be a [deeper angle](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17146308/microsoft-wunderlist-to-do-app-acquisition-complicated) to the story, which is why I am hopeful in Wunderlist's resurrection and second life.

I've just installed the app again and after signing up, I was met by the same pleasant user experience (and all the unfinished ToDos) I left three years ago. Let's see how the story unfolds.
