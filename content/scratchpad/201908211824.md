A quote from [_"Without their Permission"_](https://amzn.to/2ZNNOoV) by Alexis Ohanian

> We like to think that real talent always has a way of getting noticed. Harrison Ford was a self-taught professional carpenter when he as hired to build cabinets in the home of George Lucas, who cast him in _American Graffiti_ and set him on a course that led to Indiana Jones. If Ford hadn’t picked up the right hammer or taken another job, Solo would’ve ended up saying “I love you, too”, instead of “I know.”
