I caught myself using my old Android phone more and more these days. A 5-year-old Nexus 5, that is. I dug it out a few weeks ago. After the fresh reset all the service updates, it works as if it hasn’t been two years since I last used it for real. Trinkering with Android like in the good old days  felt exciting. In comparison, my experience with iOS has always been like living a comfortable, but relatively boring life. Always very efficient, but somewhat boring.

Perhaps, it’s time to ditch the iPhone and switch camps again?
