[The Mixtape](https://podmix.substack.com/) (not to be confused with the [Mixtape Search](https://mixtape.preslav.me)) is my carefully curated selection of podcast stories. By featuring episodes into thematic stories, I try to make your journey into the podcasting jungle a little bit more fun.

## My story with podcasts
I first discovered podcasts in 2004. Long before anyone thought podcasts would become so popular, I would manually search and download each episode on my MP3 player. 15 years later, my passion for listening is as strong as it was back in those years. Over time, I have developed a large selection of great audio content, which I want to share with you.
