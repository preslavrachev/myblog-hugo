I created [Still Hiring](https://ddglk.glideapp.io) with the sole idea of helping fellow developers and IT people find jobs during the COVID-19 crisis. It was a spontaneous decision, and not one I am hoping to necessarily profit from. I would be happy, if my tiny contribution has helped someone find a new opportunity in these difficult times.

The project is still ongoing, so I can encourage anyone looking for a job to [sign up](https://ddglk.glideapp.io). If your company is having job openings, or you might know of someone looking, there is a suggestion form inside the app that you can use to collaborate.
