[Mixtape](https://mixtape.preslav.me/) is a search engine for podcast content.
It stands out from the rest, because of its _focus on episodes, rather than
entire feeds_. Just like mixtapes in the old days, it allows listeners to search
and subscribe to topics of interests, rather than to separate feeds. It also
allows audio enthusiasts to pick and share particular audio clips with friends.
Something like this:
