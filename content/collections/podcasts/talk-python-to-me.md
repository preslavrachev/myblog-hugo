["Talk Python to Me"](https://talkpython.fm/) is a must-listen for the every programmer. Regardless of whether you have something to do with Python or not, each episode is so interesting that you'd wished you did. I was still in Enterprise Java world, when I started listen to TPTM. It opened up a parallel universe worth exploring. Especially, when it comes to data science, machine learning, and other data-related topics. Host Michael Kennedy is a well-versed person, always asking the right questions, which makes each interview that more engaging.

An absolute must-listen!
