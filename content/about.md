I am a software engineer with around a decade behind my back, developing data-intensive software systems and backend applications. I am currently a part of [KI labs’](https://www.ki-labs.com/) diverse team of data and software-aficionados. Besides my pure developer duties, I advocate for a strong culture among developers - whether through this blog, or speaking at various events.

I am an avid reader, a distance runner, and a hobby musician.

Being a genuinely curious individual, I always keep an eye on challenging problems I could help solve. If yours is one of those, [I’d love to hear from you](/contact/).
