previews from every link - even when the underlying site does not provide the
necessary metadata. NoEmbed strives to be smart, fast, and WYSIWYG - there are
no hidden ads, or suspicious analytics on behalf of end users. API consumers get
only what they paid for - engaging URL previews.</p>

<p><a href="https://podmix.substack.com/">The Mixtape</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me">Mixtape Search</a>) is my carefully curated selection of podcast stories. By featuring episodes into thematic stories, I try to make your journey into the podcasting jungle a little bit more fun.</p>

<h2 id="my-story-with-podcasts">My story with podcasts</h2>

<p>I first discovered podcasts in 2004. Long before anyone thought podcasts would become so popular, I would manually search and download each episode on my MP3 player. 15 years later, my passion for listening is as strong as it was back in those years. Over time, I have developed a large selection of great audio content, which I want to share with you.</p>

            <title>Still Hiring</title>

            <description>A list of IT companies still hiring, even in these difficult times.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I created <a href="https://ddglk.glideapp.io">Still Hiring</a> with the sole idea of helping fellow developers and IT people find jobs during the COVID-19 crisis. It was a spontaneous decision, and not one I am hoping to necessarily profit from. I would be happy, if my tiny contribution has helped someone find a new opportunity in these difficult times.</p>

<p>The project is still ongoing, so I can encourage anyone looking for a job to <a href="https://ddglk.glideapp.io">sign up</a>. If your company is having job openings, or you might know of someone looking, there is a suggestion form inside the app that you can use to collaborate.</p>

            <description>Mixtape is a search engine for podcasts. Discover and subscribe to topics you like.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://mixtape.preslav.me/">Mixtape</a> is a search engine for podcast content.
It stands out from the rest, because of its <em>focus on episodes, rather than
entire feeds</em>. Just like mixtapes in the old days, it allows listeners to search
and subscribe to topics of interests, rather than to separate feeds. It also
allows audio enthusiasts to pick and share particular audio clips with friends.
Something like this:</p>
